Hi [private],

we recently filled a mass dmca takedown for some files. Unfortunately (and without our knowledge) the company from whom we bought the code had their first version under MIT which we did not know. So there was at least one repository with an very old version (7years) which we unrightfully sent a dmca. We'd like to retract the DMCA for that repository which is listed below. We also already appologized (you’ been in cc) formerly to the repository owner. The filed a counter notice, but to speed things up, perhaps you can lift the ban of the repository in question before the 14day period.

thanks for your time

Mit freundlichen Grüßen
