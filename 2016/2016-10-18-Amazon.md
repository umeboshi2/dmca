Re: DMCA Copyright Takedown Notice

Dear Sir or Madam:
I am an attorney with Stoel Rives LLP. Stoel Rives represents Amazon.com, Inc. ("Amazon") in this matter. This constitutes notice of copyright infringement under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. The copyrighted work at issue is source code owned by Amazon. The copyrighted source code is available in the "devenv" repository posted to GitHub.com by user "mickeyghk" at the following links:  
https://github.com/mickeygjk/devenv/blob/master/.vimrc  
https://github.com/mickeygjk/devenv/blob/master/bin/echo_pass.py  
https://github.com/mickeygjk/devenv/blob/master/bin/getOdin.py  
https://github.com/mickeygjk/devenv/blob/master/bin/kinit_auto.sh  
https://github.com/mickeygjk/devenv/blob/master/bin/pyodinhttp.py  
https://github.com/mickeygjk/devenv/blob/master/.zshrc (With regard to this .zschrc file, specifically the code in the sections beginning with the words "export" and "source")  

Amazon believes that the individual that created the "devenv" repository is [private], a former Amazon employee who was not authorized to copy or publish Amazon's code.

Amazon has a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted material described above on the allegedly infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am authorized to act on behalf of Amazon, the owner of the copyrighted material, that appears to have been infringed.

By this letter, Amazon does not intend to waive any rights whatsoever and Amazon expressly reserves all such rights and related remedies.

Please contact me with any questions regarding this letter. Thank you.

Very truly yours,

/s/
