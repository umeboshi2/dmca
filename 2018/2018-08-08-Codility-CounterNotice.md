Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?  
I want to dispute the notice.

Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake? (optional)  
The code in question is a solution I wrote over 4 years ago to a programming practice problem from the Exercism service. The DMCA notice is originating from another service (Codility). I have never used Codility, and do not have an account with them. I wrote this code by myself, for practice, and according to the exercism problem itself, the source question came from http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/%7Ejdalbey/103/Projects/ProgrammingPractice.html, not from Codility.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.  

I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.  

Please confirm that you have you have read our Guide to Submitting a DMCA Counter Notice: https://help.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-counter-notice/  

I have read Github's guide to submitting a DMCA counter notice.
