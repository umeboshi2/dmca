Dear Sir/Madam,

We would like to report a major copyright infringement incident on Github servers.

We run an online magazine at sputnikipogrom.com and offer a significant share of our articles to paid subscribers only. Paid materials are filed under tag 'premium' and stored at sputnikipogrom.com/tag/premiumrussian. We only allow personal use of our paid content and strictly prohibit its open distribution.

In early July 2016, a person launched a publicly accessible page on vk.com social network where they unlawfully, without prior pronounced consent distribute our paid and copyrighted materials as PDF-files to general public.

The address of the page in question is as following: vk.com/premiumrussian.

All the files distributed on the page are uploaded to and stored at Github servers by user under an alias of 'prosvirnin' within public domain.

Since such user's activities violate our copyright and cause our enterprise significant financial losses, in accordance with Github ToS and Github DMCA Takedown Policy,

- We demand immediate deletion of 868 PDF-files and their 868 'mobile' versions with our copyrighted content alongside 853 copies of our visual artworks unlawfully uploaded to and currently publicly stored at Github servers.

User's account in question: https://github.com/prosvirnin

Public repository with our paid content: https://github.com/prosvirnin/sputnik

PDFs with our paid articles: https://github.com/prosvirnin/sputnik/tree/master/pdf/standard

'Mobile' version of the PDFs with our paid content: https://github.com/prosvirnin/sputnik/tree/master/pdf/mobile

Folder with copies of our copyrighted artworks: https://github.com/prosvirnin/sputnik/tree/master/img

- Given the magnitude of the breach, we urge you to immediately fully block 'prosvirnin' account.

- We request you to provide us with the userâ€™s email address they used for registration on your service.

We would appreciate swift resolution of the issue.
