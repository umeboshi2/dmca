**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**  
-Yes

**What work was allegedly infringed? If possible, please provide a URL:** The commercial licensing/activation system of DevExpress software - https://www.devexpress.com/Subscriptions/Universal.xml

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository's URL:**   https://github.com/dprotopopov/dimaster

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

- As of the time of this writing, this is the only outstanding repository brought to my attention.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

- No. The original DevExpress IP is available commercial through the terms and conditions of the DevExpress EULA.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**

- The code in the repository is a blatant violation of our EULA as it enables an end user to activate the commercial software (i.e. "piracy") without complying to the commercial terms of use of DevExpress software.

**Do you have the alleged infringer's contact information? If so, please provide it:** No.
