Hello, I am submitting this DMCA notice to take down the repository located here: https://github.com/r0adtr1p/Star-d. I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

I am the copyright owner of the original repository. As you can see via the commit history, I am the sole copyright owner and developer of the project.

The copyrighted work is a repository that was originally under the name Star-d, which has since been taken down. It has been renamed and is a private repository, which can be found here: [private]. The work is published and can be found at the webpage: https://www.strykd.com/frontwebb.  

The entire repository should be taken down. Here is the repository's URL: https://github.com/r0adtr1p/Star-d.  

The repository in question is not licensed under an open source license.  

The best solution for the alleged infringement is removal of the Github repo in question.  

I do not have the alleged infringer's contact information.  

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.  

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.  

I confirm that I have read Github's Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice.  

Phone number: [private].
