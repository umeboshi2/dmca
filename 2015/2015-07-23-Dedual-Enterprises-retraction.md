I've been in consultation with the appropriate individuals responsible for
the code within The Barbarian Group's [private] repo. We've come to an
understanding at this time and, while the details are being ironed out, all
parties have agreed that,currently, The Barbarian Group should have access
to the repo below.

[private]

As such, I'd like to null, or invalidate, the DCMA takedown as, at this
moment, we've agreed to an authorized use of the copyrighted material.

Again, thank you so much for your help and assistance in this situation.

Sincerely yours,
