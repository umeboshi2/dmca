**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

We made application called Expressions. http://apptorium.com/expressions  
Here is a repository when the author tries to copy it: https://github.com/lukakerr/regxr/

Our user interface is unique (among other regex apps) and this app copies it almost 1:1.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository's URL:**

Entire repository.

The interesting fact is that this person has copied our file from our app https://github.com/lukakerr/regxr/commit/b5fd4139fec0bd460c7d4df9cb312118b91ca3f5#diff-87ffcec95b769bfedeb0111379bf414a
After we reached him via email (in October 2017) and asked him to stop copying our work, he deleted this file, but it still stays in commit history. He also removed the repository then. But after about four weeks we found out that he restored it.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I haven't searched for forks.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

Our application is not under an open source license. The allegedly infringing files are published under an open source license.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**

The app in question is an almost identical copy of our work, so the best solution is to remove it completely.

**Do you have the alleged infringer's contact information? If so, please provide it:**
