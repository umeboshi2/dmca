The work infringed is the code for the leaderboard product developed and sold globally by Spinify. Spinify started development on this product in April 2016. We regularly use [private] freelancers for specific coding tasks. On 30 June, 2017 we hired [Private] through [private] to undertake some Node.js coding. [Private] signed a Spinify NDA prior to commencing work on the assigned project. We were contacted by [private] support personnel telling us that [Private] had been removed from [private] for behaviour that violated their Terms of Service. An email stating this is shown below. It was sent to my [Private], [Private].

"Hello [Private],

I am not at liberty to disclose information related to another user's account. As mentioned previously the [private] Trust and Safety team regularly reviews activity on our platform to safeguard against persons posing as legitimate members of our community. In a recent review, we found compelling evidence to support behavior that is in violation of our Terms of Service, and we have taken further action against [Private] to protect you and the community.

After being removed from the platform, it is common that a freelancer will contact a client directly offering to finish the job or recommending another developer. If you are approached, itâ€™s best for you to decline the offer, or ignore the freelancer altogether.

I'm happy to have one of our Talent Experts work with you and help you find a high quality replacement to get your project back on track.

Sincerely,  
[Private] | [Private]

[private] did not release the payment to [Private] based on this infraction. [Private] then contacted me directly on email, our live chat facility and phone to request payment. I explained that we pay our freelance workers through [private] and as it was they who had stopped his payment, he should talk to them to sort it out. [Private] was unable to sort this with [private] and continued to request payment via Live Chat and email. We maintained our position of his needing to resolve the issue with [private]. He threatened to put our code on Github and we tried very hard and nicely to request he did not do this. He has now done this and the posted files are shown below. The work he has posted is related to our backend customer portal called MySpinify and our iOS App called Spinify.
