To whom this my concern,

This is a formal request for a DMCA Takedown of the following project

https://github.com/blackboxfcsh/PointCloudVizUnityV0.1/tree/master/Assets

which contains the source code of my commercially available product "Text
Mesh Pro" which is available at the Unity Asset Store at the following
address 

https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/17662 

This user
does not have authorization for making my product and source available
publically.

I request this user either remove the complete project or make it private
only. This user is also not allowed to share this product with any other
user unless the proper license for Text Mesh Pro has been purchased.

My contact information is:

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described
above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner,
or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification
is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on
behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
