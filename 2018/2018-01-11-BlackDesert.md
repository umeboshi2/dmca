Hello Team,

My name is [private] and I am [private] of Developers in Pijamas
development group and I represent our copyrighted material which is a game
server code and other compiled binaries used to run a multiplayer MMORPG
"Black Desert Online" game server.

It has recently come to our attention that our source code, or derivations
of it have been made available, (the "Infringing Code") which is being used
to operate illegal private servers to permit access to versions of our
clients Games, which are subject to copyright
protection and various access-control measures designed to prevent
unauthorized access to and/or use of the the infringing code on non-client
servers.

The Infringing code has been made available without the consent or
authorization of the owner and its publication, manipulation and use by
third parties constitutes an infringing derivative work under the Copyright
Act. Moreover the infringing code no doubt was obtained by interrupting the
encrypted communication that exists between the consumer-side and the
server-side of proprietary game code, or by directly hacking, or otherwise
obtaining the server-side code constituting the anti-circumvention of the
DMCA and likely the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.

This letter shall serve as your notice pursuant to the Digital Milennium
Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 512) (“DMCA”) that my rights are being violated.

I provide the following information and statements relevant for this
request under the DMCA:
1. Use of our game code constitutes an unauthorized emulation of "Black
Desert Online" game server to grant ability to host a game server on
specific hardware.
2. Unauthorized use of assets, asset modification that grants ability to
play on a hosted "Black Desert Online" server with clients hardware.

The infringing code is being publicly available on GitHub without the
consent or authorization of the owner at the following links and is
designed to provide access:
1. https://github.com/alexkulya/darksavannah

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.
I am providing this notice in good faith and with the reasonable belief
that rights I own are being infringed.
Under penalty of perjury I certify that the information contained in the
notification is both true and accurate, and I have the supreme authority to
act on behalf of myself, who is the lawful owner of the copyright(s)
involved.

We are seeking GitHub immediate assistance in stopping the unauthorized and
infringing activity described above. Specifically, we request that GitHub
immediately remove the infringing code from their servers.

Thank you for your assistance with this matter.

Sincerely,  
[private]
