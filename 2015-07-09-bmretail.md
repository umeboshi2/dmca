Dear Sirs,

**Copyright Infringement**

We write to confirm the legal basis upon which you are obligated to remove the website
http://ukworkfare.github.io/bmstores/ from your service. As requested, we itemise separately
the individual legal grounds. 

**Copyright**

1. The http://ukworkfare.github.io/bmstores/ site is a straight copy taken from the source-
code and design of our own web-site.

2. The text from our site http://www.bmstores.co.uk/ has been copied and reproduced on 
the poster's site. In some cases the infringer has made minor alterations to titles or 
minor additions to our original work. These minor alterations are insufficient to prevent 
the body of the work being a breach of copyright.

3. Our site expressly puts our copyright notice at the foot of every page as follows: "© 
Copyright 2015 — B&M Retail Limited. All rights reserved"

The copying of our original work can be very clearly seen by comparing the 
http://ukworkfare.github.io/bmstores/ URL pages against those where they have been copied 
from our site at http://www.bmstores.co.uk/

A list marked "Infringer's URL's" is set out below, with the Infringing URL pages from the 
infringer's site immediately followed by the relevant page from our site. You will see that aside 
from the occasional subtle manipulation of the copy, substantially all the data, text, layout and 
photography on virtually every page is a copy of our original work and copyright.

Specifically, on the Infringer's URL pages it can also be seen that all of the product and staff
photographs on the poster's site are copied from our site. B&M Retail Limited is the sole
copyright owner of all the white background photographs of products and photographs of staff 
on our site.

Our B&M "sunburst" orange and blue logo is the design and copyright of B&M Retail Limited. 
It has been used by the Infringer without permission.
