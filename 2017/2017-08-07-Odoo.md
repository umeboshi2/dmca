**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  
Yes I have searched for forks, and found two:  

https://github.com/alangwansui/odoo9_enter    
https://github.com/kleitz/odoo9_enter  

Both these forks are exact copies of the origin repository (no
additional commit) and contains both the same infringing files.

No, this work is normally licensed under a proprietary license, the
Odoo Enterprise Edition License v1.0 (but published without
authorization):
