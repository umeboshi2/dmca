Hello,

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

*My contact information: *

*Name:* [Private]

*Company:* Netronian Inc.

*Phone:* [Private]

*Email:* [Private]

*Address:* [Private]

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described
above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner,
or its agent, or the law. I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the
information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright
owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive
right that is allegedly infringed.

The following users *bharat303* <https://github.com/bharat303> ,
*NehaBigScal* <https://github.com/NehaBigScal> ; were hired by our company
to perform work and were paid although, they should have never uploaded our
website code especially on a public repository and allow anyone to take our
code which we paid/struggled to develop. Thankfully, they have not had
access to our latest code although, they seem to have a lot of our base
development code.

They did minor fixes into our system and were paid. Somehow they got our
code and distributed to the masses. Which we would never allow because we
have a git account also, but we are not willing to share our code. Our code
is not open source since, our project is private. How you can verify that
the code is ours? Because our email address appears through the code

We require the following 2 branches to be terminated immediately and our
code to be hidden from public view on your website github.com:

https://github.com/NehaBigScal/audio_armony

https://github.com/bharat303/audio_armony

If possible terminate the 2 accounts also *bharat303*
<https://github.com/bharat303> and *NehaBigScal*
<https://github.com/NehaBigScal> since, they have hurt our business
operations by their actions. Also, because they have not followed basic
copyright/legal obligations towards our companyâ€™s code/ethics.

I can allow you access to our bitbucket repository to further verify the
similarity of the code. I am not sure what is required to further prove our
ownership of the code, but I am available at anytime to further assist you.

Attached you will find 3 images that prove my access to the code before the
date that the 2 individuals created their repositories on github.com
