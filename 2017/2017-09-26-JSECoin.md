I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

Our site was hacked and the guy that did it demanded a ransom and
uploaded our entire source code to:

https://github.com/mikefaraponov/jsecoin*
*

The material is source code to our platform and back-end server.

We need this removed as soon as possible, the source code was never
meant to be open-sourced and having it in the public domain represents a
huge security concern for us especially as we are dealing with financial
transactions.

My contact information is Skype: [private], email [private],  
Tel. [private]    
I am one of the [private] listed on the front page of our site at  
https://jsecoin.com

Github user that has done this is:

consideration.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this

authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is
allegedly infringed.

Please can someone let me know that this is being taken care of and if
the investigation is going to take more than 24 hours can we get the
source code removed temporarily in the meantime?

Kind regards,
