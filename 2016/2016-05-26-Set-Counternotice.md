First of all: "I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA
Counter Notice."

I am responding to the DMCA notice filed against  
https://github.com/vincentwoo/setgame.

The notice specifically calls out  
https://github.com/vincentwoo/setgame/blob/master/public/perm/cards.png as
infringing against works produced by Set Enterprises, presumably in
particular:  
http://www.theboardgamefamily.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/SetCards.jpg.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the
material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or
misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled. In particular:

1. My file is an original artwork with substantial differentiation in color
and shape for ease of perception by the color blind and display on the web.

2. You can't copyright game mechanics.

3. We aren't distributing a game, just an implementation of a game with
similar mechanics for academic purposes.

I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial
district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise
the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will
accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA
notification or an agent of such person.
