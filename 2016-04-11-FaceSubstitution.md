Hi

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice, and
want to submit a DMCA notice about a copyright infringement for
https://github.com/arturoc/FaceSubstitution. I'm the owner of that work
and recently seen that this other repository:

https://github.com/thehackerati/THVideoFaceSwapper

contains a copy of my software without complying with the MIT license
that my original software is under.

I've already posted an issue on their repository so they can remedy this
situation just by including the original license file but it's been ignored:

https://github.com/thehackerati/THVideoFaceSwapper/issues/14

I include in this notice the current 8 forks of the repository:

https://github.com/cyberhooper/THVideoFaceSwapper
https://github.com/epodak/THVideoFaceSwapper
https://github.com/KeeganRen/THVideoFaceSwapper
https://github.com/shadowy/THVideoFaceSwapper
https://github.com/tkiener/THVideoFaceSwapper
https://github.com/Toolwiz/THVideoFaceSwapper
https://github.com/ygx2011/THVideoFaceSwapper
https://github.com/zamboOlino/THVideoFaceSwapper

My contact information is:

The contact information for the alleged infringer is their github
account: thehackerati

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials
described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the
copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this
notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am
authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is
allegedly infringed.
