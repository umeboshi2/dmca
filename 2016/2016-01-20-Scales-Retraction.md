Re: Retraction of DMCA

A DMCA was filed on January 17, 2016 against the alleged infringer ‘PufferPanel’ organization and GitHub user ‘LordRalex’ who committed changes to a file in commit https://github.com/PufferPanel/Scales/commit/854270ba5d3bd0d47a3472b9231b5e4e4bc7b25f. I required that the file be reverted and any subsequent commits be removed.

I hereby retract that DMCA claim as changes to the file were a misunderstanding and have since been resolved.
