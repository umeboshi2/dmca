**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**  
GNU Health is licensed under the terms of the GNU GPL version 3 license (see http://hg.savannah.gnu.org/hgweb/health/file/ef6f94229750/README)

Vertical Medical is licensed under the terms of the GNU LGPL version 3 license (see https://github.com/OCA/vertical-medical/blob/9.0/LICENSE.md).
Vertical Medical violates the GNU GPL version 3 license of GNU Health because:

It does not carry notices stating that the authors modified GNU Health and the date of such changes;
It is licensed under the GNU LGPL version 3 license.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?
I require that, according to Section 5 of the GPLv3 license, Vertical Medical is published meeting the following conditions:**  
i) Vertical Medical carries prominent notices stating that it is a modified version of GNU Health, and giving a relevant date (Section 5, lett. a of GPLv3);
ii) Vertical Medical is licensed under the GPLv3 license (Section 2, lett. c of GPLv3).
