To whom it may concern,

I have read and understand GitHubâ€™s Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

My name is [private], I am the [private] of UgMO Technologies and am writing in response to the companies proprietary information being shared in a public repository by a former software contractor. I have recently found two additional repositories. We wish to have these repositories removed from public view as well. The contributor has been contacted and refuses to remove the information which is the property of UgMO Technologies. The information was unlawfully copied from the companies data base and is now being exposed on a public repository. Below please find links link to the public repositories that contain information all of which is owned by UgMO Technologies. Below the link is additional contact information for the contributor.
