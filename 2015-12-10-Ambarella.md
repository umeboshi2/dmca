Re: DMCA Takedown Notice

Dear Sir/Madam,

Pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512(c), I write on behalf of Ambarella, Inc. and its affiliates (collectively, "Ambarella") to provide you notice of copyright infringement by reason of storage at the direction of one of your users (identified as "[private]") of material that resides on a system or network controlled or operated by or for Github, and to request removal or disablement of access to the infringing material. I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

The copyrighted work that has been infringed is an Ambarella software development kit that includes Ambarella's proprietary information and is provided under confidentiality obligations. The infringing material is as follows: all of the files and folders located at the web URL https://github.com/pengdu/bbam, but excluding the files in the subfolder located at bbam/unit_test/gm. To remedy the infringement, [private] needs to remove the infringing material from Github or disable access to the infringing material.

My contact information is as follows:
[private]

Upon information and belief based on the web URL [private], the contact information for [private] is as follows: [private].

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Sincerely,  
＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿
