**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

I am the [private] of Chachani, Misti y Pichu Pichu SRL, which owns the copyright on that material.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original copyrighted work is a SDK (software development kit) for a closed source scripting API (application programming interface), which is used in a game-environment.
It offers complex behaviour and functionality to make scripting easier and more powerful for the users of our API.

The original projects the offending party copied from are accessible here:  
https://github.com/LeagueSharp/LeagueSharp.Common  
https://github.com/LeagueSharp/LeagueSharp.SDK

Those repositories are not maintained anymore and a new version from us is accessible here:   https://github.com/EnsageSharp/Ensage.SDK

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository's URL:**

The repositories can be found here:  
https://github.com/berbb/PAIO

The offending party offers a scripting API on their own, but they do copy our original SDK for their own purposes.
The offending project had multiple iterations with cleartext code, but now the project's main component is a closed serialized and encrypted file that is used in another close source project which is violating our intellectual property as well.  
Additionally, the offending party sells the compiled form of the code to other customers, a customer list is published on the Git as well: https://github.com/berbb/PAIO/blob/master/auth  
There have been other takedowns on his repositories on GitHub before. One was from a [private]:   https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2017/2017-01-27-AlterEgojQuery.md

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

The GitHub page currently lists a few forks which we also request to be taken down:  
https://github.com/jkalskawk/PAIO  
https://github.com/kyj2709/PAIO  
https://github.com/LwanVIP/PAIO  
https://github.com/platiumv1/PAIO

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

Our project does not have any license, meaning that we keep any rights to our property and license other entities on our own behalf. The offending project was not licensed by us and does not credit us at all.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**

We request that you completely remove the given repository and it's forks and prevent them from using our intellectual property again.

**Do you have the alleged infringer's contact information? If so, please provide it:**
