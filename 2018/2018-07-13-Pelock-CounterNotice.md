**Are you the owner of the content that has been disabled, or authorized to act on the owner’s behalf?**  

I am the owner of the content that the requester is willing to take down.

**What files were taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL:**  

https://github.com/dex4er/drpdecompress

**Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?**  

I want to dispute the notice.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake? (optional)**  

All code was licensed on GPL and of my authorship and there is no possibility that the requester has any rights to this code.

The DMCA notice is ridiculous because my code was literally one single line of meaningful code: calling of external GPL library: UCL 1.03 library http://www.oberhumer.com/opensource/ucl/ This is old, well known library with compression/decompression routines. It is a part of Debian distribution since ages. As http://metadata.ftp-master.debian.org/changelogs/main/u/ucl/ucl_1.03+repack-4_copyright says:

Copyright: 1996-2004, Markus Franz Xaver Johannes Oberhumer
License: GPL-2+

There was no single line from this library in my repository as far as my code is dynamically linked to this open sourced library.

It is very likely that this single line of my code cannot be copyrighted at all. There is a merger doctrine: some ideas can be expressed intelligibly only in one or a limited number of ways. In such cases the expression merges with the idea and is therefore not protected.
