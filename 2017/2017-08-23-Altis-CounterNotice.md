Hello GitHub,

My forked repository  
https://github.com/DeadMemez/ProjectAltis-OldAcornAcres,  
just got taken down for copyright infringement by a prior Project Altis
team member.

I want to counter this notice, because Disney owns the source code for
Disney's Toontown Online and all Toontown games, so the staff team of
Project Altis has no excuse to copyright their GitHub commits on
the repo, because it's not their code, it's Disney's code that they are
using for the game. Disney's Toontown Online got shut down by Disney
in September 2013, but that doesn't give a right for the other Toontown
games to copyright their source code, because Disney owns the code, not
them.

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Counter
Notice.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that
the
material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or
misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.

I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial
district in which my address is located, and I will accept service of
process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent
of
such person.

Thanks for your time,
