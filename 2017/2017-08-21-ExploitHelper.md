Dear administrators,

I am sorry for trouble with you agian,Last time we you have helped me delete the ExploitHelper project from the github.But now I found that there are the another two forkers that have forked my project so I must need help from you again.I am deeply sorry for the trouble I have caused you!

Before sending this request to you,I have read and understand github’s guide to filing a DMCA Notile.

First I must first state that it was our mistake that led us to trouble you.It happened like this,our group started a project called “ExploitHelper” on github in 2017 April.Our group members come from Sichuan university and all of us are students.In the last week,our leader tells us that this project can’t open at this time,so we deleted the project in the last week,but we found that this project has been forked by two other people,so we contact them and hope they can help us delete the project,but we do not received any response from them,and the project can also be searched on github.so we send this request to you,and hope you can help us delete the project.

The project forked by ExpLife is here:https://github.com/ExpLife/ExploitHelper, this project is forked from my responsity.

The another one is here: https://github.com/Merhie/ExploitHelper

Hello administrators,the forkers of our project do not infringe our copyright,just becase our project can not be opened at this time.It’s our careless that led us to put our project on the github.Now we want to delete the project from the github,but we can not contact the forkers immediately,so we hope you can help us.
