DMCA Notice

Date: January 17, 2017

Dear [private] and/or GitHub Copyright Agent:

I, the undersigned, state UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY that:

[1] I have read GitHub's guidelines on submitting DMCA Notices;

[2] I am a person injured, or an agent authorized to act on behalf of a person injured by a violation of the U.S. Copyright laws, in particular Section 501 of Title 17 of the United States Code, commonly referred to as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, or "DMCA";

[2] I May Be Contacted At:

Name of Injured Party: Apple Inc. ("Apple")  
Name and Title: [private]  
Company: Kilpatrick, Townsend & Stockton LLP  
Address: Two Embarcadero Center, Suite 1900  
City, State, and Zip: San Francisco, CA 94111  
Email Address: [private]  
Telephone: [private]  
Fax: [private]  

[4] I have a good faith belief that the files in the forked repositories identified below (by URL) are unlawful under these laws because, among other things, the files offer to distribute copies of copyrighted works belonging to Apple;

[5] Reason:
Content Type: Reproduction of Apple's internal and proprietary source code. The script at issue is an internal script and it includes Apple's copyright notice. It is not open source.
Violation(s): Copyright Infringement

[6] Please act expeditiously to disable the content found at the following forked repositories, which infringe Apple's rights by reproducing substantial portions of Apple's internal and proprietary source code;

[7] Where can Apple's original work be seen: Apple's internal workflow;

[8] I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing repositories is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and

[9] I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Thank you for your kind assistance.

Truthfully,

[private]

[Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton LLP]
