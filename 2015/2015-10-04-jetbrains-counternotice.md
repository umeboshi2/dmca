I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the
material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or
misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled. I was fully
unaware of the DMCA i apologize for that.

I consent to the jurisdiction of Northern District of California, and I
will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA
notification or an agent of such person
