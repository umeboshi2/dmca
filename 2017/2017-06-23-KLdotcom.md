**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

I am the owner of the code and design behind http://www.kellylougheed.com, which I published at https://github.com/kellylougheed/portfolio. I do not own the fonts, the icons, or the background picture of Santa Monica from unsplash.com used on the web page, but the website design and code are my original creations.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

I recently noticed that my website design and code are being used at https://harlyon.github.io/, and my code (with altered content) is being published at https://github.com/harlyon/harlyon.github.io. The code is closest to a slightly older version of my website, which is saved on GitHub and which I am linking below.

harlyon.github.io’s index.html file uses the same code as my index.php file (which is mostly HTML).

harlyon’s index.html file: https://github.com/harlyon/harlyon.github.io/blob/master/index.html

My index.php file: https://github.com/kellylougheed/portfolio/blob/e1818046020c427efbbc6658d250d2be578f4d6d/index.php

harlyon.github.io’s style.css is nearly identical to my style.css file, with the exception of one font.

harlyon’s style.css file: https://github.com/kellylougheed/portfolio/blob/e1818046020c427efbbc6658d250d2be578f4d6d/style.css

My style.css file: https://github.com/harlyon/harlyon.github.io/blob/master/style.css

The only part of the code I do not own is the media queries in style.css, which is generic code for the Bootstrap-style grid system taken from https://github.com/jhu-ep-coursera/fullstack-course4. However, I designed and coded the rest of the website layout.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository's URL:**

https://github.com/harlyon/harlyon.github.io/blob/master/style.css

https://github.com/harlyon/harlyon.github.io/blob/master/index.html

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I have not found any forks of my portfolio repository or harlyon’s harlyon.github.io repository.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

The work does not have a license.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**

The best solution would be for harlyon to remove the infringing index.html and style.css files and redesign their website using their own CSS and original layout.

**Do you have the alleged infringer's contact information? If so, please provide it:**

GitHub username: harlyon
