Dear github team,  

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Counter Notice.

Takedown notice URL to be challenged: https://github.com/kfit-dev/lazop-api-client  

The code in the repo was downloaded from https://rubygems.org/gems/lazop_api_client and modifed to be used together with our application. The license is open sourced under MIT license,
hence permits reuse within proprietary software provided that all copies of the licensed software include a copy of the MIT License terms and the copyright notice.
I have included the same MIT license in the repo link above.  

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.

I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States,
otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.

My contact details are as follows:
