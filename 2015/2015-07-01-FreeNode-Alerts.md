Dear madam or sir,

My Name is [private], I am the copyright holder of the software code "freenode-alerts" and as such have been notified that somebody has put my code publicly accessible via GitHub:

https://github.com/Krenair/freenode-alerts

The repository contains two files at the time of writing this email:

- - README.md - Though this text has also been created by me, it's honestly not really necessary to remove this file.
- - core.js - This is the file I would like to have removed from GitHub servers, all 299 lines in this code is copyrighted material and has been written my me.

As copyright holder, I would like this code to be removed asap.

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Best regards

[private]
