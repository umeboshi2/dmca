I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

We had someone collaborating on a private REPO project stored here for our client Teach Tennis International. Their corporate
site is hosted here: http://www.teachtennis.net <http://www.teachtennis.net/> . They have not yet launched their product. We
have just had a rogue developer fork the repo and change to public.

It is a like for like copy as can be seem clearly from the Readme file included and the structure of the repo. It is
copyrighted material and we really need it to be removed immediately to protect our client.

The user would need to delete the repository from public listing on github. I have followed the electronic trail and it
points to this agency http://www.mobilewebpro.pl I will be keeping an eye on all users related to this agency in the future
to make sure this stays the case.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not
authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner,
or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Many thanks for your help,
