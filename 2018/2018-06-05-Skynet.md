Dear github managers, my English name is [private], I am a Chinese.My english is not very well,but i will try my best to complete my takedown-notice,and i wish you can read what I write.At this time, I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

Today,when I serving web,I find an article name "skynet源码分析“(url:http://blog.shixbo.com/2018/01/24/skynet%E6%BA%90%E7%A0%81%E5%88%86%E6%9E%90/),after open it. I fill so angry because,the content of that article is the same as one of my article which is name "skynet源码赏析”(url:https://manistein.github.io/blog/post/server/skynet/skynet%E6%BA%90%E7%A0%81%E8%B5%8F%E6%9E%90/), I am very sure that it is the copy of "skynet源码赏析" without quote the source and no inform me. It is an absolutly an infringing content! It just change the name of the article!

I can find the infringer's github url in his/her website, his/her github name is flesh0731(url:https://github.com/flesh0731)

I have several evidence to prove that I am the real author of “skynet源码赏析” which is rename as "skynet源码分析" by flesh0731. Before I list all the evidence, mybe it's important to explain why I am sure that submit this compliant to github is the correct approach. My blog website is running on github server, which I use Hugo, a static website generator, to generate the static website. I create a repository at github(url:https://github.com/Manistein/blog) on 27 Aug 2017,and I also create two useful branch, master and gh-pages.Everytime I push my new content to gh-page branch,it can be find on my website https://manistein.github.io/blog/. As my blog website is running on github server, I use domain resolve website to resolve the domain name http://blog.shixbo.com . I also resolve my website domain name, I got these information below:
[private]  
[private]  

the result ip address is the same of mine. so I am sure that flesh0731's blog is also running on github.According to github's guideline,if my takedown notice is pass,you will disable the page which is infringing me.

At first, I write "skynet源码赏析" on YNote,but for some reason, we can not visit it via this url(https://note.youdao.com/share/?id=9d2b8a03fdd9cd4947ca4128d30af420&type=note#/), it is a share url,but i can provide it's create information  
[private]  

it create at 2017-04-02
Since the share link of this article is not available, I first push it to my blog repository on on 29 Aug 2017(url:https://github.com/Manistein/blog/blob/35e37f87016f6716ecf69314b4fcb23cfa014ede/content/post/server/skynet/skynet%E6%BA%90%E7%A0%81%E8%B5%8F%E6%9E%90.md https://github.com/Manistein/blog/blob/3c9ad6bea087a197f7b05fdd5acc44882336cacd/post/server/skynet/skynet%E6%BA%90%E7%A0%81%E8%B5%8F%E6%9E%90/index.html)

while at flesh0731's repository, the article's first push time is on 25 Jan 2018 (https://github.com/flesh0731/flesh0731.github.io/blob/8b8263a56633b13251ce12447f5f274cd1168e8e/2018/01/25/skynet%E6%BA%90%E7%A0%81%E8%B5%8F%E6%9E%90/index.html)

The first evidence is my article is publish earlier than infringer.

As the url(https://github.com/flesh0731/flesh0731.github.io/blob/8b8263a56633b13251ce12447f5f274cd1168e8e/2018/01/25/skynet%E6%BA%90%E7%A0%81%E8%B5%8F%E6%9E%90/index.html) show above, just visit it, there are many image url is direct to my another repository the Photo repository（https://github.com/Manistein/Photos/tree/master/DailyUse/skynet_study）,back to the flesh0731's article, we can easy to find that all the iamge it use is from my Photo repository  
[private]  

I think, the evidence is enough, I hope you can disable the two urls:  
https://github.com/flesh0731/flesh0731.github.io/blob/8b8263a56633b13251ce12447f5f274cd1168e8e/2018/01/25/skynet%E6%BA%90%E7%A0%81%E8%B5%8F%E6%9E%90/index.html

The infringer should delete the article named “skynet源码分析" from his/her website or quote source from my article(url:https://manistein.github.io/blog/post/server/skynet/skynet%E6%BA%90%E7%A0%81%E8%B5%8F%E6%9E%90/)
