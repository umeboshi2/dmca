I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.
I'm with YelloTravel, and we'd like to request that the forked source code at
http://github.com/petardimic/dam
and all subdirectories be removed from github. As you'll note at, say,
whole code was developed at YelloTravel as part of an internal project,
contains an zari.me service protocol, INTERNAL USE PDF ATTACHMENTS and
UNENCRYPTED SECURITY INFORMATION.

You may contact me at [private]

We are trying to contact the developer, but no information is given, then concluded to
submit a notice.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described
above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright
owner, or its agent, or the law,
and I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this
notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am
authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is
allegedly infringed.

SIGNATURE
Sincerely,
[private]
