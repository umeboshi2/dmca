It looks like rontian posted almost the entire (copyrighted) GreenSock library at https://github.com/rontian/GreenSock/tree/master/com/greensock without our permission. Much of the code is fine to be placed there (we allow it for portions of our libraries that we make available on our site for free), but certain portions are not. For example, TransformManager is a $299 product that we sell here:  
http://www.greensock.com/transformmanageras3  
and rontian is sharing it with the world for free here:  
https://github.com/rontian/GreenSock/tree/master/com/greensock/transform .

Also, there are several members-only plugins and classes that customers must pay to get access to (see https://www.greensock.com/club for details), like MotionBlurPlugin, Physics2DPlugin, PhysicsPropsPlugin, and more, but rontian is sharing them all here:
https://github.com/rontian/GreenSock/tree/master/com/greensock/plugins . 

We have spent thousands of hours crafting that code and it's obviously unfair
to allow it to be shared for free on github, as it could significantly hurt our business. I'm sure it was probably just a mistake, but we filed an issue at the site but rontian doesn't seem to be responding so I would like you to proactively remove all GreenSock code from rontian's repository and prevent it from being posted again (if possible).

You can see in the comments in the files themselves (like at https://github.com/rontian/GreenSock/blob/master/com/greensock/transform/TransformManager.as ), there is a copyright notice and a link to the terms of use.
