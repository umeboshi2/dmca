GitHub has reconsidered the takedown notices previously processed and published at:

- https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2016-02-04-Wahoo.md
- https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2016-02-04-Wahoo-2.md
- https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2016-02-09-Wahoo.md

Upon further consideration, GitHub has determined that the notices do not meet the requirements for a takedown notice under our [DMCA Takedown Policy](https://help.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy/) because the code that has been targeted for removal is licensed to "any person . . . without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software" subject only to the requirements to include a copy of the license and provide proper attribution, which appears to be satisfied by most, if not all, of the accused projects. 

Accordingly, GitHub has decided to reject these and any other notices related to this licensed content and restore any content previously disabled due to these notices. We regret any inconvenience that may have been caused by GitHub not catching the deficiencies in these notices sooner. If you have been affected by one of these takedown notices and have any questions, please do not hesitate to [contact us](https://github.com/contact).
