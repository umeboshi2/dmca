Re: Takedown Request of Github Post Containing Xilinx Inc.’s Copyrighted Material

Dear Github DMCA Team:

As you know, this firm represents Xilinx, Inc. (“Xilinx”) in connection with certain intellectual property
matters. Xilinx’s offerings are founded on and used in connection with numerous pieces of copyrighted
material and trade secrets, including proprietary source code.

Xilinx recently learned that certain of its proprietary and copyrighted source code, passphrases, and
software “keys” have been made available on your website. We appreciate you acting on our original
May 27, 2016 letter and removing this infringing material. However, we subsequently learned that
certain “forks” have made this information available at:

https://github.com/bittergrass/hdl_decrypt  
https://github.com/carlosFPGA/hdl_decrypt  
https://github.com/Christeefym/hdl_decrypt  
https://github.com/kammoh/hdl_decrypt  
https://github.com/mfkiwl/hdl_decrypt  
https://github.com/shenpeifu/hdl_decrypt  
https://github.com/howardyan93/hdl_decrypt  

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web
page is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. In fact, Xilinx has taken
substantial steps to protect this information, and is highly concerned by the presence of this material on
your website. Therefore, we request that you immediately remove the entirety of the material posted
detailed above.

I have read and understand GitHub’s Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. Further, I swear, under penalty of
perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am authorized to act on behalf of
the copyright owner of an exclusive right that is infringed. If needed, please do not hesitate to contact
me.

Date: June 3, 2016 

Sincerely,  
[private]  
Attorney for Xilinx, Inc.
