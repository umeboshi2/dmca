Hi [private],

I confirm I want to retract the two DMCA takedowns published at:
    -
https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2018/2018-05-17-PHPFormBuilder-1.md
    -
https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2018/2018-05-17-PHPFormBuilder-2.md

These 2 DMCA have been sent by mistake and I want them to be fully
retracted.

The repositories to be re-enabled are  
    - https://github.com/wpninjas/ninja-forms  
    - https://github.com/wpninjas/ninja-forms-conditional-logic  

I hope these 2 repositories will be re-enabled as quickly as possible.

Thanks,
