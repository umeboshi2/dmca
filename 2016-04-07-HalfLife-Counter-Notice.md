I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Counter Notice.

The code in question was released publically to my community forums under a
GPL 3 license as per this web page:

http://forums.cloudsixteen.com/threads/half-life-universe.14138/

The license clearly states, "This program is free software: you can
redistribute it and/or modify it". Furthermore, the author clearly posted
in the release thread that, "it was a great project to contribute to over
the years but I think it's time to rightfully pass the content down to the
community that still exists."

It is for these reasons that I believe that permission was granted to use
the code to be distributed in our public repository, with the original
copyright notice left intact.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the
material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or
misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.

I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the Northern
District of California where GitHub is located, and I will accept service
of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent
of such person.
