**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  
Yes, can't tell how many people have used this work. It has been online for almost a year.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**  
The infringing material is provided to our customers under our licensing policy, which can be found at the following URL: http://cryozonic.com/licenses/stripe.html. Distributing the infringing material is in direct violation of our license.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**  
For the affected user to effectively remove the copyrighted material from their account, they would need to recursively delete all of the following files and directories from all 9 branches (master, MAD-43-PricesUpdate, MAD-78-RemoveShopsharkCopyright, MAD-79-GoogleMerchantFeedWithoutWebsiteCode, MAD-82-GeoIPUrlBlocking, MAD-83-ProductInfoUpdate, MAD-88-DeleteOrderUnderACL, dev1, staging) of their project at https://github.com/MISMAD/mis/

**The files that the user must recursively remove are the following:**   
app/code/community/Cryozonic/Stripe/ app/design/adminhtml/default/default/template/cryozonic/ app/design/frontend/base/default/template/cryozonic/ 43 app/design/frontend/base/default/layout/cryozonic_stripe.xml app/design/adminhtml/default/default/layout/cryozonic_stripe.xml app/design/frontend/base/default/layout/customer/savedcards.xml app/etc/modules/Cryozonic_Stripe.xml app/locale/en_US/Cryozonic_Stripe.csv skin/adminhtml/base/default/cryozonic_stripe/ skin/frontend/base/default/cryozonic_stripe/ lib/Cryozonic
