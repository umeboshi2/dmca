To whom it may concern:

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to filing a DMCA Notice.

ParadoxLabs develops, maintains and sells an extension for use with the
Magento Commerce Platform. The user JollyR0ger has elected to create a
repository of a Magento installation that includes our commercial extension
as public. We do not believe this is a malicious attempt to distribute our
extension; we believe he simply didn't realize that his actions could result
in individuals downloading our extension without purchasing it.

The account and code in question is:

Account: https://github.com/jollyR0ger [Private]

Path to Copyright Code: https://github.com/jollyR0ger/juvenile/tree/master/app/code/community/ParadoxLabs/AuthorizeNetCim

To remedy the copyright issue, the user will need to make the repository
private.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described
above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner,
or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification
is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on
behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

I do not have contact information for [Private].

You may contact me at:

Thank you for your help rectifying this situation.
