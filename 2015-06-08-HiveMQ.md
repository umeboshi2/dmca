Hi Github Team,

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

The Repository https://github.com/doomoon/copycat by user ‘pipinet’ (https://github.com/pipinet) used decompiled code of our commercial server software “HiveMQ” (http://www.hivemq.com), owned by dc-square GmbH (http://www.dc-square.de)

There is evidence that the code was stolen from HiveMQ:

- https://github.com/doomoon/copycat/blob/master/copycat-broker/src/main/java/com/doomoon/copycat/ioc/bootstrap/Bootstrap.java : Stil uses the original HiveMQ package namespace, e.g. https://github.com/doomoon/copycat/blob/master/copycat-broker/src/main/java/com/doomoon/copycat/ioc/bootstrap/Bootstrap.java#L45

- https://github.com/doomoon/copycat/blob/master/copycat-broker/src/main/java/com/doomoon/copycat/common/configuration/PAYG.java : Uses internal configuration for our pay-as-you-go licensing (PAYG). The PAYG licensing service is available here: https://payg.hivemq.com

- https://github.com/doomoon/copycat/blob/8a38be97b62f3d2358aa7bc43d1b2021adb1df17/copycat-broker/src/main/java/com/doomoon/copycat/common/configuration/MQTT.java : The name HiveMQ was not replaced: https://github.com/doomoon/copycat/blob/8a38be97b62f3d2358aa7bc43d1b2021adb1df17/copycat-broker/src/main/java/com/doomoon/copycat/common/configuration/MQTT.java

- https://github.com/doomoon/copycat/blob/8a38be97b62f3d2358aa7bc43d1b2021adb1df17/copycat-broker/src/main/java/com/doomoon/copycat/common/configuration/SSL.java#L29 : The name HiveMQ was not replaced

- https://github.com/doomoon/copycat/blob/8a38be97b62f3d2358aa7bc43d1b2021adb1df17/copycat-broker/src/main/java/com/doomoon/copycat/server/BrokerServer.java#L108: The name HiveMQ was not replaced

- There are many others usages of the original HiveMQ namespace available, which can be found with the Github search: https://github.com/doomoon/copycat/search?p=2&q=hivemq&utf8=%E2%9C%93

The complete repository, all files, all content, all lines of code, and all mentions of HiveMQ must be deleted immediately both on Github and locally, or we will take legal action against this individual and all parties involved.
