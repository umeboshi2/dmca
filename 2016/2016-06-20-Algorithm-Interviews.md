I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

The copyrighted work you believe has been infringed:  
*https://github.com/yuzhangcmu/LeetCode/algorithm/interviews/*  
<https://github.com/vlsi1217/LeetCode-1/blob/master/algorithm/interviews/machineZone/RangeModule.java>

Identify the material that you allege is infringing the copyrighted work
above:  
https://github.com/vlsi1217/LeetCode-1/blob/master/algorithm/interviews/  
https://github.com/aiyasong/LeetCode/tree/master/algorithm/interviews  
https://github.com/albertguosgp/LeetCode/tree/master/algorithm/interviews  
https://github.com/AlienceGG/LeetCode-2/tree/master/algorithm/interviews  
https://github.com/allen6432/LeetCode/tree/master/algorithm/interviews  
https://github.com/aluo86/LeetCode_algorithm/tree/master/algorithm/interviews

What the affected user would need to do in order to remedy the infringement:  
Could the users delete this folder?  
https://github.com/vlsi1217/LeetCode-1/blob/master/algorithm/interviews/               
<https://github.com/vlsi1217/LeetCode-1/blob/master/algorithm/interviews/machineZone/RangeModule.java>

I already delete the folder from my Github a couple of months ago, so I
hope all the users could remove the interviews folder as these files
may compromise the validity of tests the companies use internally, like machine zone.
