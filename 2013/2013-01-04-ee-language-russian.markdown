Copyright Claim

1. https://github.com/EllisLab/EE-Language-Russian

2. All files.

3. [private] (translator)

4. EllisLab, http://ellislab.com/

5. I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

6. I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

7. [private]

P.S. But I see the same situation with other files published by [private].

P.P.S. I translated these files 1) for the expressionengine.com website (this fact was mentioned in the emails sent to the expressionengine.com staff), not for [private], EllisLab, or any other person, 2) with a condition to mention me as the author/translator 3) on the expressionengine.com website. And that was observed for several years.
