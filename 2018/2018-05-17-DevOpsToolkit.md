Yes

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**  

Most of the books available in https://github.com/TechBookHunter are illegally posted. Mine are "The DevOps 2.0 Toolkit" and "The DevOps 2.1 Toolkit - Docker Swarm" posted in https://github.com/TechBookHunter/Free-DevOps-Books. 
The same books are legally available from https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BJ4V66M and https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N25BVHX. 
The direct links to the content I own and is published illegally are https://github.com/TechBookHunter/Free-DevOps-Books/blob/master/book/The%20DevOps%202.0%20Toolkit.pdf and https://github.com/TechBookHunter/Free-DevOps-Books/blob/master/book/The%20DevOps%202.1%20Toolkit%20-%20Docker%20Swarm.pdf  

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL:**

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  

Since all the repositories owned by TechBookHunter contain illegal books, all the forks of it's repos are illegal as well.  

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**  

Those are the copies of the books legally published in Amazon, O'Reilly, and other vendors and publishers.  

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**  

No. It's pirated content.

I don't.
