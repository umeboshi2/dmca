**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf?**

I am an attorney at law representing Hyperconnect, Inc. who is the copyright owner. Hyperconnect, Inc. is a corporation duly incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Korea with an address at [private]. Hyperconnect, Inc. developed "Azar" which embodies the concept of social discovery. (Please refer to https://hyperconnect.com/?lang=en)

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

We are providing a service which is called 'Azar', that connects people to people globally through video communication. You can find this app on https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.azarlive.android .  
A GitHub user 'KobeGong' decompiled the app and uploaded the generated source files to the public repositories without any authorization.  
We are demanding the repositories to be removed in that 'Azar' is not an open-source software.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL:**

The files posted on both (https://github.com/KobeGong/AzarDec) and (https://github.com/KobeGong/AzarDev2) should be taken down.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

To the extent we have searched, there is no fork besides the files I stated above.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

Our software is not an open-source software, and the allegedly infringing files posted by 'KobeGong' have never been licensed from us.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**

The whole repositories of 'KobeGong' I stated above are infringing our intellectual property rights. Thus, the only way to solve this situation is that the repositories should be removed.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it:**

I wrote an email to '[private]' which is shown at GitHub page on July 3, 2018. But, there has been no response from him/her.

**Type (or copy and paste) the following statement: "I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration."**
