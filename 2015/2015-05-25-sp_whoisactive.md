Hi,

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

I am the author of a copyrighted work, "Who is Active?" (sp_whoisactive),
which I distribute through my own web site, SQLblog.com. This work is
copyrighted by the US Copyright Office:

http://cocatalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?v1=4&ti=1,4&SC=Author&SA=Machanic%2C%20Adam&PID=NcKGrVnUP4g8T6LqYoMlq7xbdezFU&SEQ=20150518150126&SID=5

The license for this work prohibits redistribution without my written
consent.

Unfortunately, this work is being redistributed via GitHub, here:

https://github.com/ktaranov/sqlserver-kit/blob/master/Strored%20Procedure/sp_WhoIsActive.sql

Note that the person has left included the very header text which prohibits
him or her from redistributing this work.

My request is that this work be removed from GitHub immediately.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described
above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner,
or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this
notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am
authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is
allegedly infringed.

Thank you,
