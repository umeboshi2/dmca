Dear Github,

My name is [private], my Github username is pengfuyuzhen. I'm writing
on behave of myself and [private] (cc'd here).

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

On Sep 22 2015, I have made my Github repository under the name of
tappiGroup (https://github.com/pengfuyuzhen/tappiGroup) private. I am the
owner of this repository. Inside this repository are the source files of an
iPhone application that [private] and I have been working on. [private]
and I are the copy right owners of most of the materials inside this
repository. Files that we don't have copy right ownerships have notices on
top of each file, indicating their ownerships, references, and our rights
to use them.

I have discovered that a Github user under the username of applideveloper
has uploaded the identical repository (
https://github.com/applideveloper/tappiGroup) under his/her own
repositories, and have made it public. I believe this is an infringement to
my and [private]'s copyright.

Most of the files inside that repository have declared ownership belongs to
[private], under the format of

// *file name*

// tappiGroup

//

// Created by *name* on *date*.

// Copyright (c) 2015 *name*. All rights reserved.

Such files include, but not limited to (I have personally investigated each
of cases below):

tappiGroup-master/tappiGroup/tappiGroup/AddProfileViewController.h
tappiGroup-master/tappiGroup/tappiGroup/AddProfileViewController.m
tappiGroup-master/tappiGroup/tappiGroup/AppDelegate.h
tappiGroup-master/tappiGroup/tappiGroup/AppDelegate.m
tappiGroup-master/tappiGroup/tappiGroup/BetaConfirmationView.h
tappiGroup-master/tappiGroup/tappiGroup/BetaConfirmationView.m
tappiGroup-master/tappiGroup/tappiGroup/CameraCaptureViewController.h
tappiGroup-master/tappiGroup/tappiGroup/CameraCaptureViewController.m
(and many more)

To remedy the infringement, I ask the person or entity under the username
of applideveloper to take down and delete the public repository under the
name of tappiGroup.

Here's my contact information:

Here's contact information of the infringer:

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described
above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner,
or its agent, or the law. I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the
information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright
owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive
right that is allegedly infringed.
