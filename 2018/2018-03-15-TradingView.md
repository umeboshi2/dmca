**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**  
According to the License Agreement forking and sharing charting library files or the complete library or the repository is not allowed.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**  
Removal only, as we won't be able to track them. We couldn't find these users in our collaborators or customers list, means the library was stolen.

**Do you have the alleged infringer's contact information? If so, please provide it:**  
Unfortunately we do not.
