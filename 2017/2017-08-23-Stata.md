Hello,

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

Stata and all of its versions of software works have registered
copyrights of StataCorp LLC. Stata Press and all of its publications
have registered copyrights of StataCorp LLC.

According to the DMCA, the use of the following URL(s) creates an
unauthorized and illegal use of the Stata copyright:

https://gist.github.com/anonymous/9e859518a59af776fdd9f674adfa0b4f

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described
above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner,
or its agent, or the law.

The user is showing pirated/cracked serial numbers and also providing
links to torrent sites which allow for unlawful and unauthorized downloads
of our Stata software. You can see the original work at
https://www.stata.com.

Please remove as soon as possible.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this
notification is accurate and that I am authorized to act on behalf of
the copyright owner regarding a right that is infringed. You can reach
me at [private] for further information or clarification.

Kind regards,
