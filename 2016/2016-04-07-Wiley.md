I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. I am one
of the authors of the Oracle Certified Associate Java Programmer Study
Guide. It has come to my attention that a user is illegally hosting a copy
of the book on github at:

https://github.com/apoterenko/information-technology-ebooks/blob/master/%5BJAVA%5D%5BOCA%20Oracle%20Certified%20Associate%20Java%20SE%208%20Programmer%20I%20Study%20Guide%20Exam%201Z0-808%5D.pdf

The book is on sale at Amazon at
http://www.amazon.com/OCA-Certified-Associate-Programmer-1Z0-808/dp/1118957407
and the copyright is held by the publisher (Wiley).

Looking through the repository, all of the other files in it appear to be
copyrighted books as well. In order to keep any files online, the user
should cite where they came from to show the books are in fact free PDFs.

I went through the forks* as well and 30 of them contain our copyrighted
book. The others were forked before our book was in the repository. The
other forks still have copyrighted material, just not our book. The URLs of
the forks containing an illegal copy of our book are:
