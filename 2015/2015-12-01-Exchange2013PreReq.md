Thanks

Hi there

Following a previous contact to report an abuse, I have been informed to contact you
I found on Github a PowerShell script (Windows_2012_Exchange_2013_Prerequisites.ps1 - located here on Github https://gist.github.com/aldofunes/4a62df7412b49fb88a14)I have created and published at one unique place (https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Exchange-2013-Prerequisites-3f8651b9)
As the author and owner of this script I don't want to have it published anywhere else
I have contacted the person who published it on Github ([private] - aldofunes) requesting to remove this script from Github and did not receive any answer neither action being taken

As he is not the author and because I want to keep traceability of any of my publication, I'm requesting to remove the script

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice
I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.
I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Thank you
