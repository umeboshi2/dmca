I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

The copyrighted work that has been infringed: http://stackoverflow.com/a/33139702/45375 <http://stackoverflow.com/a/33139702/45375>

The infringing material is the contents of https://github.com/barsh/true-case-path <https://github.com/barsh/true-case-path>, which is - except for reformatting and packing - a verbatim copy of my stackoverflow.com answer - and nothing else.

I want the infringer to give proper attribution, given that answers on stackoverflow.com are are licensed under cc by-sa 3.0 with attribution required: http://stackoverflow.com/help/licensing <http://stackoverflow.com/help/licensing>. Specifically, I want file `README.md` to acknowledge the source of the code by linking to the stackoverflow.com answer, and I want to be listed as a contributor in the "contributors" property of the repo's `package.json` file. If he's not prepared to do that, I want him to delete the repository.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Note that all attempts to engage @barsh in a dialogue about this have been unsuccessful, and enough time has passed to assume he won't respond.
