*Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s
behalf?*  
I am the copyright holder.  

*Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work
that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it
is posted online.*  
The work is a Java project named MapDaemon, originally worked on solely by
myself and uploaded to a private repository on Gitlab. I gave explicit
permission to an organization called "CM-SS13" (previously called "Colonial
Marines Space Station 13") and it's development team to use this tool in
their closed source game.  
The original repository is here:  
[private]  
[private]  
The copied content which I gave permission for is here (also a closed
source Gitlab project):  
[private]  
[private]  

*What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if
the entire repository, the repository’s URL:*  
Originally, the following repository was in violation. After contacting
them, they removed the infringing content. To clarify,
[private] is NOT currently violating my copyright, but a great
number of it's forks ARE.  

The files WERE located here. None of these URLs still work. In the next
section, I list the location of all existing infringing content.  
[private]

*Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or
repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified
separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.*
At the time of writing this, there are 46 forks of the original repository.
The original repository and a single fork have removed the content. Here is
the precise location of all infringing content at the time of writing:
