As [private] at Telebreeze Corporation, I'm acting on behalf of the company, which is the copyright owner.  
On February 23rd, 2018 we received the following letter from an anonymous hacker, who got illegal access to our platform and had stolen the source code of our product (a software platform for IPTV/OTT services), web-site, internal CRM system, and other internal resources and accounts:  
"We still have root access to your system, including Elecard (site source code, databases, servers, backups); Telebreeze (databases; source code; servers, backups); Workstations (like personal computers), Customers servers. But do not worry, all data then safe with us =)  
Can we share this information?  
Sorry, we forgot to mention source codes like with C, C ++, etc. of your applications"

Recently, we have discovered that our source codes are available on the GitHub resource by the following link:  
https://github.com/Telebreeze

The source codes are not licensed under an open source license, therefore publication of the source codes violates our copyrights and confidentiality.

We ask the GitHub team to close public access, as soon as possible, and to completely remove all repositories listed below:  
https://github.com/Telebreeze/Telebreeze-Core  
https://github.com/Telebreeze/Telebreeze-Bot  
https://github.com/Telebreeze/Telebreeze-Site  
https://github.com/Telebreeze/Telebreeze-Skype-Listener  
https://github.com/Telebreeze/Telebreeze-CRM-Module  

We would like to initiate the legal action against the person, who posted our sources to public, and would appreciate any help, which GitHub team could provide us in order to identify him.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
