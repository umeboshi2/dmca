**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's
behalf?**  
Yes

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that
has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is
posted online.**  
I created and sell an asset that I wrote on the Unity3d.com asset store.
Here is a link to the asset:

https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/26661

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if
the entire repository, the repository's URL:**  

This is the github repository:

https://github.com/DarkRay/Unity3D-bluetooth

The above repository was actually reported and taken down a while back.
When it came back up a few days ago I contacted the person who posted it
and took it down last time asking them why they put it back up.

They said that they didn't put it back up. They blame it on github that you
guys put it back up.

Whatever happened, please disable that repository as it is loosing me sales
on the Unity asset store.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or
repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified
separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  

Yes, here is another copy of it that someone else posted:

https://github.com/niyouwoxi/Unity3D-bluetooth

You can see right in the readme.md comments that they acknowledge they
don't have the right to post it. How can you guys let this kind of thing
happen?

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source
license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open
source license, or are they in violation of the license?**  

NO

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there
specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**  

NO, just take it down.

**Do you have the alleged infringer's contact information? If so, please
provide it:**  

Just what is on those pages.
