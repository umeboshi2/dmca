Hello,

Could you please take down the page at <http://dcaps.github.io/>? It duplicates the page that I maintain at <http://dcaps.info>. I actually created that Github page, but unfortunately due to a backup misconfiguration I almost immediately lost the Gmail and Github credentials, which I didn't notice for a few months. You can see that the last update to the GitHub site was over a year ago. At this point, I think that I must simply treat the page as a copyright violation.

Therefore, I sincerely claim the following:

1. I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

2. I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

3. I have read our Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice: https://help.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/

My contact information is as follows, with my preferred contact method being email:  
Email: [private]

Thank you,
