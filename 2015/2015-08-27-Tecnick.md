To whom it may concern,

and the following forks that have files renamed or moved in another
folder (FORKS2):

* https://github.com/paterik/BGBarcodeGenerator
* https://github.com/wodka/BGBarcodeGenerator
* https://github.com/ZeusbaseWeb/barcodegen

I have investigated each individual case and I have noticed that the
projects listed above are using source code copied from the project
https://github.com/tecnickcom/TCPDF
originally hosted at http://sourceforge.net/projects/tcpdf/ but all
original notices about author, copyright and license were removed or
replaced.

The first commit on the copied PARENT project is indicated as 30 March
2012, so it can be safely compared against TCPDF version 5.9.153
released 28 March 2012
(https://github.com/tecnickcom/TCPDF/tree/9c8c5f961f858aa85ecfec130d2935884ca39eb8):

The following files present in the PARENT and FORKS1 projects appears to
be almost verbatim copies of the original one, with the exception of the
legal notices removed (author, copyright and license):

* barcodes.php
* datamatrix.php
* pdf417.php
* qrcode.php

The original code is released under the GNU LGPLv3 license and
copyrighted by [Private] - Tecnick.com LTD, but none of this
information is present in the copied files.
https://github.com/tecnickcom/TCPDF/blob/9c8c5f961f858aa85ecfec130d2935884ca39eb8/LICENSE.TXT

In the projects listed as FORKS2 the infringing file are:

in https://github.com/paterik/BGBarcodeGenerator and
https://github.com/wodka/BGBarcodeGenerator

* Base1DBarcode.php
* Base2DBarcode.php
* modules/Datamatrix.php
* modules/pdf417.php
* modules/qrcode.php

in https://github.com/ZeusbaseWeb/barcodegen

* third_party/datamatrix.php
* third_party/dns1dbarcode.php
* third_party/dns2dbarcode.php
* third_party/pdf417.php
* third_party/qrcode.php

The options to remedy the infringment are:

1. delete the project - this seems the best option for the PARENT and
FORK1 projects;
2. if the license is compatible with GNU-LGPLv3, replace the infringing
files with the original ones, or reinstate the original notices (author,
copyright, license);
3. delete the infringing files and use the new external library
https://github.com/tecnickcom/tc-lib-barcode (originally based on the
same code).

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials
described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the
copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.
I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this
notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am
authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is
allegedly infringed.

The only contact information I have about the infringers is the one
derived from their GitHub page (please see the preceding links above).

Please send me a prompt response indicating the actions you have taken
to resolve this matter as soon as possible.
