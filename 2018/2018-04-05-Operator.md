**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository's URL:**

We initially wrote regarding this Archive which has been removed (thank you)

[repository disabled per previous DMCA takedown notice]

We neglected to search for forks.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

All of these must be removed.
