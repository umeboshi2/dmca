Hello Github, 
First, I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Counter
Notice.

I'm mailing regarding the repo https://github.com/khoiln/RunKit which has been disabled due a takedown
notice filed by Duemunk (https://github.com/duemunk/Async).

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that
the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or
misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled. I've contacted
Mr [private] himself, and changed the LICENSE to his name. 

I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial
district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise
the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will
accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA
notification or an agent of such person.

My contact information:  

[private]  

Regards,  
[private]
