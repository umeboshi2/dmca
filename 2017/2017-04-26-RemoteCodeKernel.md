Hi,

First and foremost, I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a
DMCA Notice. A few users have forked a repository and have removed/modified
the licensing.  

The original repository is located here:  

+ github.com/dude719/RemoteCode-Kernel

The forked repositories I am referring to, and must be removed reside here:

+ github.com/Noahii/RemoteCode-Kernel  
+ github.com/A5-/RemoteCode-Kernel  

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described
above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner,
or its agent, or the law.

I would like each of the above specified forks removed. All of the material
contained in each fork needs to be removed, or each fork needs to be
removed all together.

Here is my contact information:

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this
notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am
authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is
allegedly infringed.

Thanks,
