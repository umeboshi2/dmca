Hello,

First of all, I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA
Notice.

I am the author of iOS VideoKit paid framework.The product web page is here
<http://iosvideokit.com/>

One of our customer has just reported that iOS VideoKit source code is
shared in a github repository which has public access.
As I mentioned above, VideoKit is a commercial product and the binary
format or source code of VideoKit can not be shared in a public area.

The github repository that has VideoKit source code:

https://github.com/nemoleo/StarFactory

and below is the full url where iOS VideoKit is found,

https://github.com/nemoleo/StarFactory/tree/8b9649e3b6a7d84d73c8da3439481b6df9565035/StarFactory/External/VideoKit

In addition,

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described
above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner,
or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this
notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am
authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is
allegedly infringed.

Also,

My contact information is below,
