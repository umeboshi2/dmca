Dear GitHub Copyright Agent:  
  
I, the undersigned, state UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY that:  
  
[1] I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.  
  
[2] Copyrighted work I believe has been infringed: Among other things, Qualcomm's confidential and proprietary source code for mobile phone software which Qualcomm shares with third parties only under NDA or similar contract. The names of the folders used by the posting parties makes it patently clear that the materials are Qualcomm-specifically by the use of "qcom_proprietary" in the name of each repository. Most or all of the contents of these folders appear to contain direct, literal copies of this mobile phone software.  
  
[3] Material I allege is infringing the copyrighted work listed in item #2: Please act expeditiously to remove the following repositories and branches, each of which infringes Qualcomm's rights by reproducing substantial portions of Qualcomm's confidential and proprietary source code:  
  
https://github.com/a170785/android_vendor_qcom_proprietary  
https://github.com/AnClark/android_vendor_qcom_proprietary  
https://github.com/Artogn/android_vendor_qcom_proprietary  
https://github.com/CodyEngel/android_vendor_qcom_proprietary  
https://github.com/defcomk/android_vendor_qcom_proprietary  
https://github.com/sandeepbhuyan/android_vendor_qcom_proprietary  
https://github.com/GithubHolyCode/android_vendor_qcom_proprietary  
https://github.com/givanse/android_vendor_qcom_proprietary  
https://github.com/thanhltd/android_vendor_qcom_proprietary  
  
[4] The affected user requires a license from Qualcomm to possess a copy of the files. The affected user should contact Qualcomm at [private] to confirm authorization and/or a license to possess a copy of the subject copyrighted files. But under no circumstances is the user authorized to make these files publicly available, and addition of a statement of attribution is insufficient to remedy the infringement.  
  
[5] I May Be Contacted At:  
  
Name of Injured Party : Qualcomm Technologies, Inc.  
Name and Title: [private]  
Company: Qualcomm Incorporated

[8] I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
