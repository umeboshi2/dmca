In addition to confirming that "the pictures and formulas" (as well as
several tables) in the infringing repositories have been copied from the
online edition of FLP-NM, I have confirmed that the Chinese text in the
files is a direct translation of FLP-NM. Thus the files in this repository
not only infringe on the FLP-NM copyrights, they violate the exclusive
FLP-NM licenses held by Basic Books and Shanghai Scientific & Technical
Publishers.

all those listed above. The only solution for these numerous infringements
is to remove all of the infringing repositories from GitHub's servers.
