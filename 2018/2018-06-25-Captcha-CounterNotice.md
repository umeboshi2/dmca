Hi, this is a result of the client switching languages (c#->node) several times during the job resulting in him assuming he was due something when he burned through all his purchased time. He lost his paypal dispute (see, goods were delivered). However, he never bought the rights to the code. He simply bought the rights to a copy of the code.
Here is a copy of the invoice. He merely bought a copy and after he attempted to scam for a refund (again, paypal sided with me and they only do that if you really haven't done anything wrong) and lost there. Then he attempted to slander me on reddit and lost there and got his account banned for posting personal info (he doxxed me). His attempt to ownership of my code is not only false it's criminal and petty revenge. The only reason he did this was that he was some famous streamer's page was taken down with dmca and got that idea in his head. Literally, this guy doesn't understand how code ownership works (I only grant a license to use my software, ownership is WAY more). Here is the invoice, There is NO item denoting ownership of the code. Also, he lied in your post as he does have my contact information as it's on the invoice [private]
