Hello Dear Github:

I'm copyright owner: [private],It is nice to be able to use Github such a professional and efficient platform, and now I have a need to be very hopefully able to get Github's support and resolution.

**I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.**

I created a Repository called my_projects in my Github : Apigflying 3 months ago, which include my sensitive information and my company important information. Later found that before I deleted , the user named jackshine completely forked my entire Repository,and it still exists.

The Github's URL about my forked Repository :
https://github.com/jackshine/my_projects/

Since "my_projects" contains the company's important source code , algorithm and system configuration information , belonging to the company's internal data assets , so I hope Github as soon as possible to help me remove jackshine/my_projects and thank you very much!

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

I have read Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takendown Notice:https://help.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/

Hoping for your response and thanks agiain.
