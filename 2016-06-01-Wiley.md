I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. I am one
of the authors of the Oracle Certified Associate Java Programmer Study
Guide. It has come to my attention that a user is illegally hosting a copy
of the book on github at:

https://github.com/satishnaidu/ebooks/blob/master/Java/ServerSide/J%23/JavaSE8/OCA%20Oracle%20Certified%20Associate%20Java%20SE%208%20Programmer%20I%20Study%20Guide%20Exam%201Z0-808.pdf

The book is on sale at Amazon at
http://www.amazon.com/OCA-Certified-Associate-Programmer-1Z0-808/dp/1118957407
and
the copyright is held by the publisher (Wiley).

Looking through the repository, all of the other files in it appear to be
copyrighted books as well. In order to keep any files online, the user
should cite where they came from to show the books are in fact free PDFs.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described
above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner,
or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this
notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am
authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is
allegedly infringed.

Thank you,
