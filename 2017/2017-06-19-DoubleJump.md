Yes.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

There are no forks of the repo that I can find.

The work isn't licensed under an open source license because it was never meant to be open source. The license included in the code has been altered.

No, the code is private and the license states that no unauthorized changes are to be made.
