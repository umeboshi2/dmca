Hello Github,

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

Github user [private] has posted an account titled "Mastercard-poc" which can be found at https://github.com/MasterCard-poc

In this account is a repository https://github.com/MasterCard-poc/connected-cities called "Connected-Cities".

This entire repository contains data which is proprietary to Mastercard and should not be published externally. The code is used as part of Mastercard's "Smart Cities are Connected Cities" programs https://newsroom.mastercard.com/digital-press-kits/global-cities-smart-cities/

The user needs to remove this content as it contains proprietary Mastercard data and was not approved to be posted externally.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you.
