**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes. Im the unique author and unique propietary of the commercial product/library/project: ElektroKit

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

It lives ONLY in Envato's CodeCanyon marketplace:
https://codecanyon.net/item/elektrokit-class-library-for-net/19260282

I don't understand what kind of "detailed description" I should include, but I'll try it: ElektroKit is a framework for .NET developers, it includes user-controls, extension methods and more.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository's URL:**

https://github.com/mkbiltek/ElektroKit

ALL THE FILES OF THE ENTIRE FORK, WITHOUT EXCEPTION, should be removed forever.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I searched for more forks, but I didn't found anything more than that one. I think this is respnsability of GitHub to seach for more illegal shared forks, not mine responsability.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

Not a license, ElektroKit was declared a commercial product, I'm the copyright.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**

The fork It should be removed, otherwise the only thing I could do Is take action by the legal justice in my country ( police / informatic delictive activities police ) on GitHub responsibles of maintaining this illegaly shared product visible and stored in their server's database.

I really would like to solve this illegal issue in a friendly way by deleting/hide the repository in GitHub, because the GitHub's repository page appears as the first result when searching for the terms "ElektroKit" in Google, and that is killing my bussiness and I can't tolerate it anymore.

**Do you have the alleged infringer's contact information? If so, please provide it:**

After a simple research in Google, this is what I found:

Website: [private]  
Twitter: [private]  
Mail (1): [private]  
Mail (2): [private]

I already tried to contact to all the e-amil addresses days ago, but I didn't received a response. Some of the provided e-mail addresses does not exist anymore.
