I am the original author of patch for handshake 10 of RTMP protocol: 

https://github.com/rtmpdump/rtmpdump-2.5/blob/master/librtmp/rtmpe10.c  
https://github.com/rtmpdump/rtmpdump-2.5/blob/master/librtmp/rtmpe10.h  

These files were leaked into public access via sad mistake
and they were not planned to be published here or anywhere else.
Four years ago I took sources of rtmpdump 2.4, added these two files
mentioned above and therefore I increased version from 2.4 to 2.5.
Soon it turned out this version 2.5 is not open source compatible
and the decision was taken to eliminate it from public access.
Therefore the entire sub-repository must be taken down:  

https://github.com/rtmpdump/rtmpdump-2.5

as this unofficial version 2.5 is my proof of concept code,
it has nothing to do with original versions of rtmpdump
and I do not permit anyone to publish it.

If someone thinks this unofficial version should be kept for
historical purpose, then please note I am not a museum piece.
But if someone still insists, then do it by yourself
and do not involve me there. I want to be forgotten.
