* https://github.com/wa/wahoo

## Context

On August 26, 2015, I, @bucaran, and "oh-my-fish" collaborators, led by @bpinto, decided to replace the entire source code of "oh-my-fish!" with the entire source code of "wahoo", but keeping the "oh-my-fish" name. Soon after the merge and due to conflicts with @bpinto regarding the direction of the project and other issues, we decided to not continue working together and ended our relationship. I would return to "wahoo" and @bpinto would return to the original "oh-my-fish", still available at:

* https://github.com/oh-my-fish/framework.

Nevertheless, @bpinto has continued to use the entire "wahoo" source code without my consent and expelled me from oh-my-fish organization. They also failed to state "oh-my-fish" is a complete copy of "wahoo" or provide copyright attribution since our separation. At this point, I do not wish any of the source code in "wahoo" to be used in any form by "oh-my-fish" and would like to kindly request "oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish" to be entirely removed.

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice:
