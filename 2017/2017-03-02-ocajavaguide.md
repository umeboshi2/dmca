Hi [private],

Resubmitting this request for third time. All of the required statements are contained in it. Please read it in full.

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. I am one of the [private] of the Oracle Certified Associate Java Programmer Study Guide. It has come to my attention that a user is illegally hosting a copy of the book on github at:
https://github.com/ncalderon/oca-java8-guide

The book is on sale at Amazon at http://www.amazon.com/OCA-Certified-Associate-Programmer-1Z0-808/dp/1118957407 and the copyright is held by the publisher (Wiley). I am authorized to speak about copyright infringement and I have included a member of the publishing staff, [private], on this email thread.

Looking through the repository, it includes multiple chapters and combined work from the book, enough that the entire repository should be closed immediately:
