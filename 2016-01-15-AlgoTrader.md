I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

I am the creator and copyright holder of the AlgoTrader open source project.
In late 2014 the open source version of AlgoTrader has been discontinued. At
that time the Google Code Project has been deleted. If needed I can provide
a copy of that last state of the project on Google Code before the Google
Code Project was deleted.

However, I realized that quite a few people forked AlgoTrader on GitHub and
I therefore request those forks to be removed.
