Hi - I am the [private] of 'Jelly Sprites', a paid asset on the Unity Asset Store. The asset is primarily a physics tool used to add dynamic behaviour to static 2D sprites inside the Unity game engine.

I stumbled across a repository that seems to have shared up my asset in full, making it very easy to find and download the asset for free by simply searching google for 'Jelly Sprites github'.

The offending files are all the files in the following directories (and all the subdirectories contained within):

https://github.com/RunningJellyGame/JellyGame/tree/master/game/Assets/JellySprites  
https://github.com/RunningJellyGame/JellyGame/tree/LHXversion1//game/Assets/JellySprites  
https://github.com/RunningJellyGame/JellyGame/tree/chao/game/Assets/JellySprites

I believe this is an honest mistake (looks like a student sharing up a test project from a few years ago) but I would appreciate my asset from not being made publicly available as this will directly impact on my paid sales. The best fix would be to simply remove the above directories from the respository.

The owner of the offending repository is [private], according to their github profile.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.
