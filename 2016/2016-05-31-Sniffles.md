Hi,

First and foremost, I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a
DMCA Notice. It has come to my attention that some of my work published on
GitHub has been used to profit from. That is the reason I am filing this
DCMA notice.

The work I am referring to can be found here:

https://github.com/Tobba/Sniffles-CSGO-Packet-Sniffer-Public

This is a fork of my previously public repository that I have since made
private as people were trying to profit from it.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described
above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner,
or its agent, or the law.

Since users still have access to the code through this fork, I would like
it removed.

All of the material contained in the fork needs to be removed, or the fork
needs to be removed all together.

Here is my contact information:

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this
notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am
authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is
allegedly infringed.

Thanks,
