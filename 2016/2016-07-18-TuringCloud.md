Hello,

I have an urgent DMCA takedown notice to submit. I believe this was done by a rogue former contractor who had previously extortedâ€‹ us with a threat of doing this.

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

The copyrighted work that has been infringed is the source code for the product, Turing Cloud, (www.turing-cloud.com), that my company (Turing Technology, Inc.) has built.

My company is the copyright owner and I am authorized to act on the company's behalf.

This repository https://github.com/simonkoener66/tr-email is infringing upon my company's copyright by posting the entire source code for the product without permission. I have searched for forks and I couldn't find any. The work's license is proprietary ownership.

The only thing the affected user could do to remedy the infringement is to remove the entire contents of the repository (i.e. all of our source code and commit history, etc).

Here is my contact information:

I do not know any contact information of the alleged infringer other than: https://github.com/simonkoener66

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

I have ready your Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice.

Here is my electronic signature:
