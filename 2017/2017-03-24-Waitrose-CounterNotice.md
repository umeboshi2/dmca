**Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?**

I want to dispute the notice.

**In the takedown notice the following claim is made:**

"The whole directory contains all the sourcecode of our (Waitrose) Branch Picking System. In the wrong hands this could be devastating to our company so we need this code removed asap."

The source code has nothing to do with the Waitrose Branch Picking System. I do not know what the Waitrose Branch Picking System is.

I am happy to change the name of the repository to remove "Waitrose" from it.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake? (optional)**

I believe that someone has seen the "MyWaitrose" and assumed that the code is something that it is not without actually looking at the code.

**Type (or copy and paste) the following statement: "I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled."**
