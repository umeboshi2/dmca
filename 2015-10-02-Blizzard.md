Hello [private],

My name is [private], I am the [private] with Irdeto USA, Inc.

Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. ("Blizzard") has performed an review of 50 forks within the repository located at https://github.com/gloomyson/StarCraft and have confirmed that all 50 contain artwork assets created by Blizzard for the game Starcraft.

Furthermore, the description of the repository is "HTML5 version of StarCraft game". This repository is a blatant, direct, literal copy of the StarCraft software and is disturbing source code and artwork assets owned by Blizzard without permission.

This can be seen by comparing the demo screen shot in the repository located at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gloomyson/StarCraft/master/img/Demo/Demo.jpg to screen shots of the original StarCraft, viewable at the following URLs:
