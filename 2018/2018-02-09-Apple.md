Date: February 8, 2018  
  
Dear [private] and/or GitHub Copyright Agent:  
  
I, the undersigned, state UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY that:  
  
[1] I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice;  
  
[2] I am a person injured, or an agent authorized to act on behalf of a person injured by a violation of the U.S. Copyright laws, in particular Section 501 of Title 17 of the United States Code, commonly referred to as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, or "DMCA";  
  
[2] I May Be Contacted At:  
  
Name of Injured Party:Apple Inc. (“Apple”)  
Name and Title: [private]   
Company:Kilpatrick, Townsend & Stockton LLP  
Address:Two Embarcadero Center, Suite 1900  
City, State, and Zip:San Francisco, CA 94111  
Email Address:[private]    
Telephone: [private]   
Fax: [private]   
  
[4] I have a good faith belief that the files in the forked repositories identified below (by URL) are unlawful under these laws because, among other things, the files offer to distribute a copyrighted item without authorization from the owner of the copyright.

Content Type:Reproduction of Apple’s "iBoot" source code, which is responsible for ensuring trusted boot operation of Apple's iOS software. The "iBoot" source code is proprietary and it includes Apple’s copyright notice. It is not open-source.  
  
Violation(s):Copyright Infringement

Furthermore, based on the representative number of forks we have reviewed, we believe that all or most of the forks in these networks are infringing to the same extent as the parent repositories. Accordingly, and because there are a growing number of forks that contain the infringing content at issue, we respectfully request that GitHub disable the entire networks.  
  
[7] I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration; and  
  
[8] I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.  
  
Thank you for your kind assistance.  
  
Truthfully,
