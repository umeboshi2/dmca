The DMCA notice has linked to content that is not available to determine if any copyright was violated. Additionally the content is not something that is capable of being copyright as it is a common test that people issue through many platforms and by hand for interviewing javascript candidates. Codility is is using the DMCA to take down numerous tests that people have posted in order to gain a monopoly on candidate testing. They do not own these tests, they are pieces of code and under copyright law are not copyright able. Additionally my code is licensed as MIT which allows reuse and adaptability.
