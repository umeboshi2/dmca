Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to you because somebody uploaded the decompiled and
deobfuscated source code of my software to GitHub. I have read and
understand GitHub's Guide to Filling a DMCA Notice. The complaint is
about my software product called "yCopp Ultimate Adidas Bot". I sell
this software on my webshop:
http://ycopp.com/product/ycopp-ultimate-adidas-bot-1-year-license-for-new-customers-windows-only/

This is the repository where my source code has been uploaded:
https://github.com/ducducbass/yCopp-UltimateAdidasBot2.0  

Every line of code in this repository is my personal work. Thus the user
needs to delete the entire repository to remedy the infringement.

This is my contact information:
