Re: DMCA Violation – Takedown Notice

Dear GitHub Copyright Agent:

This firm represents NCSOFT. NCSOFT is a leading online, game developer and publisher that has produced popular games such as Lineage, Lineage II and Aion, among others (the “Games”). The Games consist of copyrighted game software code, including consumer-side code and server-side code (operated and controlled by NCSOFT), which interact to facilitate gameplay by the end-users.

Since the resolution of our prior takedown notice dated March 28, 2016, our client has investigated and identified additional webpages where NCSOFT’s server code or derivations of it have been made available on GitHub.com, (the “Infringing Code”) which is being used to operate private servers to permit access to versions of our client’s Games, which are subject to copyright protection and various access-control measures designed to prevent unauthorized access to and/or use of the Games on non-client servers. The Infringing Code has been made available, and altered, on GitHub.com, without the consent or authorization of NCSOFT, and its publication, manipulation, and use by third parties constitutes an infringing derivative work under the Copyright Act. Moreover, the Infringing Code no doubt was obtained by interrupting the encrypted communication that exists between the consumer-side and server-side of NCSOFT’s proprietary game code, or by directly hacking or otherwise obtaining server-side code, constituting a violation of both the anti-circumvention provision of the DMCA and likely the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.

This letter shall serve as your notice pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 512) (“DMCA”) that NCSOFT’s rights are being violated. In addition, I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. We provide the following information and statements relevant for this request under the DMCA:

• I have been engaged to act on behalf of the copyright owner, NCSOFT.

• The copyrights at issue are the copyrights in the proprietary game software code (specifically, the server-side code) which allow users to access and play the Games via the NCSOFT server;

• The Infringing Code is being displayed and altered on GitHub.com without the consent or authorization of NCSOFT at the webpages identified below, and is designed to provide access via private servers to the Games.
