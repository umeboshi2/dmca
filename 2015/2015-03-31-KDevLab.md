Dear GitHub DMCA Team:

I'm writing to you on behalf of KDevLab Team. It's regretful that I have to ask for your help to remove repositories which are forks of a repository created by us named "miui-v6-russian-translation-for-miuiandroid". Since we have removed our repository till now, three users still own forks about it, listed as follows:
