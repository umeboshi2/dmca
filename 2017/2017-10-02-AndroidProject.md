Hello:

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice；

2 years ago, Because of the important data involved, I deleted my project “AndroidProject”;

But I found fuhongliang copied my project;

https://github.com/fuhongliang/AndroidProject

This project is copying my project, and the submission records are mine;

I was hoping you could help me delete this project;

My GitHub account is [private]  
My name is [private]  
Here is my contact information：  
email : [private]  
phone : [private]  
address : [private]  

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

thanks!
