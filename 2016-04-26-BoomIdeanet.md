I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

The bulk of our website:  
http://boomideanet.com  
has been copied and rebuilt in github:  
http://guangfnian.github.io/AhaIdea/AhaIdea.html

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described
above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner,
or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this
notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am
authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is
allegedly infringed.

Note: The social media links are intact and go to our English language
pages related to them. Contact pages and some other pages go to Error 404
pages. But most of the pages of our copyrighted website have been copied.

We tried to chat with the visitor during the process, but with no success.
He/She was on our site multiple times, once for 4 hours. We have since
blocked the IP addresses corresponding to the visits.

Action Desired: We request that you take down the alternate version of the
site. We have not created it. We do not know who did, why they did, or what
their intention is in doing so.

I contacted GitHub support and was encouraged to take the current course of
action. The content of that exchange follows.
