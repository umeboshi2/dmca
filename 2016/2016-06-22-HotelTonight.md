I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.  I seek the removal of the infringing material described below from your website and server.  We believe this material was posted by a former employee named [private].  We also seek the removal of any other material that is proprietary to HotelTonight that may have been posted by [private] in a private repository.

Hotel Tonight owns the proprietary, unpublished software code listed below. Hotel Tonight believes the GitHub user, “pochen”, is a former employee, [private] who had access to said code. In comparing the code sets, we believe that all hosted content on GitHub are direct, literal copies of Hotel Tonight’s proprietary code. 

The following are the three public repositories found. There may be others that he didn't make public – Should these exist we request they be disabled as well.

I am providing this notice in good faith and with the reasonable belief that rights my company owns are being infringed.  Under penalty of perjury I certify that the information contained in the notification is both true and accurate, and I have the authority to act on behalf of HotelTonight in this matter.
