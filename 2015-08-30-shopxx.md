I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. I have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright or intellectual property owner, its agent, or the law. I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the above information is accurate and that I am authorized to act on the copyright or intellectual property owner's behalf.

We appreciate your assistance as we investigate the activities that lead to the unauthorized posting of SHOP++’s materials.
