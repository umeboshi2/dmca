To whom it may concern,

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Upon looking at the below link, the user, Atul-sac, violated Asurion company policy by uploading copyright code. The Pega application is owned by Asurion and therefore the whole node server folder contains private source code files belonging to Asurion. We are requesting for this folder to be removed for the site. This is proprietary company information that is in direction violation of Asurion corporate policy.

The file can be found at: https://github.com/Atul-sac/nodeserver

When accessing the link, the information shared clearly shows that the file is Asurion-specific and contains code from our application. The files include Asurion Internal username and server name. This information can be found in
