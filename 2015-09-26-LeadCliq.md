Dear Designated Agent:

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

This letter is official notification under Section 512(c) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") requesting the immediate removal of infringing material from your servers. I request that you immediately notify the infringer of this notice and inform them of their duty to remove the infringing material immediately, and notify them to cease any further posting of infringing material to your server in the future. The information required to contact the owner of the infringing material is attached hereto as Schedule A. The infringed work is the web based system created & used by our company, LeadCliq.

Files listed within Fathur/Marketplace & Hondo094/LeadCliq are a direct, literal copy of LeadCliq property. Both repositories have been reviewed and confirmed to fully infringe on our system. Within Fathur's repository, only the project name and readme.md were changed at all, and within Hondo094's repository nothing was changed. We request that all files within these repositories be removed immediately.

Please be advised that law requires you, as a service provider, to remove or disable access to the infringing materials upon receiving this notice. Under United States law, a service provider such as yourself enjoys immunity from a copyright lawsuit provided that you act with deliberate speed to investigate and rectify ongoing copyright infringement. If service providers do not investigate and remove or disable the infringing material this immunity is lost. Therefore, in order for you to remain immune from a copyright infringement action you will need to investigate and ultimately remove or otherwise disable the infringing material from your servers with all due speed should the direct infringers, registered Github users, not comply immediately.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Should you wish to discuss this with me please contact me directly.
