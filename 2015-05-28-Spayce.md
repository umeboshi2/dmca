I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. Github user " glennchrino " (https://github.com/glennchirino <https://github.com/glennchirino>) has stolen our iOS source code, with version date approximately 1.5 months back, and put up all files and our private key on his public github page. This is a direct, literal copy of our work.

The complete repository, all files, all content, all lines of code, and all mention of Spayce must be deleted immediately both on github and locally, or we will take swift legal action against this individual and all parties involved. The code on his profile lives here: 

https://github.com/glennchirino/Spayce <https://github.com/glennchirino/Spayce>

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
