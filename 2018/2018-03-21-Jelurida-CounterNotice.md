**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake? (optional)**  
1. We forked the Nxt in Q4 2016 when we were developing our previous project called 'Conch', the forked Nxt version is before version 0.11.6. We studied the LICENSE.txt of Nxt and believed that Nxt is an open-source and free program under the GNU General Public License version 2 and we could develop our own program base on it.
We found the old repo of Nxt before its license was changed to JPL in version 0.11.6. The license is https://bitbucket.org/JeanLucPicard/nxt/src/a5374fa2700bdd87cb4a2c0e0dce09a0ab87e13d/LICENSE.txt. The Sharder-chain program is remains an open-source and free program which is under the MIT licenses.
We declared it in https://github.com/Sharders/sharder-chain/LICENSE.txt. with Nxt listed as the third party library in the https://github.com/Sharders/sharder-chain/3RD-PARTY-LICENSES.txt.
In a word, we So believe that it is legal for Sharder-chain to develop its project based on the Nxt with the GPLv2.0 license.

2. We will make some changes of Sharder-chain repository as follows:**  

a) Change Sharder-chain license from MIT to GPL and clearly declare it.
b) Declare Nxt as the third party open-source program and list it and its GPLv2 license in the 3RD-PARTY-LICENSES.txt.
c) If b) is not enough, for each and every Nxt source code file we will add the fork declaration and state its original author 'The Nxt Core Developers.' and 'Jelurida IP B.V.'.
