rights.

3. Description of copyright infringement

The publisher's repository- with the use of an identical unauthorized
virtual cat character as well as every other visual part contained in the
repository folder- causes average customers to believe that such content is
authorized by Outfit7 Limited.

Regarding the fact that Outfit7 Limited has more than 2,8 billion downloads
worldwide and more than 230 million monthly active users, and that
marketing for Talking Tom mobile app was mostly conducted with internal
marketing, it is safe to say that most users connect Talking Tom mobile
application with Outfit7 Limited.

The app was first published on iTunes, on June 26th 2010 and entered Google
Play on November 3rd 2011.

4. Statements
- I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.
- I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials
described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the
copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.
- I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this
notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am
authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is
allegedly infringed.
