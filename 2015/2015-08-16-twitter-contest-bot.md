GitHub Staff,

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

The following repositories violate copyright on intellectual property
that I own, namely twitter-contest-bot:

The copyrighted work at issue is located at  
https://github.com/kurozael/twitter-contest-bot

They must take down the repository completely or fork the repository
properly so it links back to the original repo, as they have not been
given permission to copy the repository and change the credits to make
themselves look as though they created it (and seem to be trying to
profit from it on Fiverr.com)

The repositories where our copyrighted material is hosted is at the
following location:

/// You can reach me at [private] for further information or clarification.
My phone number is [private] and my mailing
address is [private].

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials
described above as allegedly infringing is not authorized by the
copyright owner, its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in the
notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner or am
authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is
allegedly infringed.
