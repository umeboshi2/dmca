Dear Github DMCA Agent:

We recently learned that some github users downloaded our software from our website (https://ahri.tw/en/Download/) and decompiled. Then publish the decompiled source code on github.

The original software code is in our private repository https://github.com/joe791023/BaronReplays

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed."
