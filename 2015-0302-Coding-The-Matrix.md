I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. I
have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials
described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the
copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I swear, under penalty of
perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and
that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of
the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

The GitHub repository Popetc/Coding-the-Matrix (at
https://github.com/Popetc/Coding-the-Matrix), contains
many files for which I am the copyright owner. The infringer's
username is Popetc.

During a Coursera course I taught in 2013,
"Coding the Matrix" (which is a trademark I own), I distributed these
materials via Coursera to the students for their work in that course.

The materials include:
(1) instructions (in pdf form),
(2) support code, and
(3) stencils for the students to fill in the answers.

In categories 1 and 2, the files are identical to my copyrighted
files. In category 3, the files are nearly identical; they differ
only in the fact that these files have the answers filled in.
This is potentially damaging because students in the current Coursera
course or in my Brown University course can look at these files and
copy the answers. This undermines my ability to grade those
students on their own ability.

The copyrighted material is as follows:

* In 01.python_lab: python_lab.pdf, python_lab.py, submit_python_lab.py

* In 02.inverse_index: dictutil.py, inverse_index_lab.pdf,
inverse_index_lab.py, submit_inverse_index_lab.py.

* In 03.hw0: hw0.pdf, hw0.py, submit_hw0.py

* In 04.hw1: hw1.pdf, hw1.py, submit_hw1.py

* In 05.vec: submit_vec.py, test_vec.py, vec.pdf, vec.py

* In 06.politics_lab: politics_lab.pdf, politics_lab.py,
submit_politics_lab.py

* In 07.hw2: hw2.pdf, hw2.py, submit_hw2.py, vecutil.py

* In Resources: GF2.py, image.py, plotting.py, vec.py

I ask that all of these files be removed from the public repository as
soon as possible.
