Hello,

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

The original item is a theme I developed for Themeforest - http://themeforest.net/item/react-material-design-multipurpose-template/14918846, it is also hosted on my web-site and can be found at http://react.pimmey.com.

My item is being sold at this web-site - http://www.koffeeion.xyz/item/react-23, it is clearly a pirate site selling various themes without rights of doing so. I’ve been told it is being hosted via GitHub, so that’s why I’m writing you.

The user must delete the whole web-site http://www.koffeeion.xyz and never do anything like that again.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.
I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Cheers,
