I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

I am writing on behalf of NewsCred Inc. <https://newscred.com/> 

We noticed that the code published in Github public repository 'https://github.com/shuvzzy/cms_newscred' by Github user 'shuvzzy

our private repository '[PRIVATE]'.

We ask that you remove the infringing materials as soon as possible.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described
above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner,

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this
notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am

allegedly infringed.
