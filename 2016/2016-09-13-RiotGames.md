**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**  
Yes

**What work was allegedly infringed? If possible, please provide a URL:**  
Internal Riot Games documentation is both provided and linked-to at the below listed links. Unfortunately I can't provide a URL because it's internal (private) documentation.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository's URL:**  
https://gist.github.com/christinegp/fb2ee61667105251f95319ac0077b3f3

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  
Yes. There do not seem to be any forks that I can find, at the moment.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**  
No, this is not licensed under an open source license.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**  
A complete removal would be best, as internal documentation is linked-to in the source code. These links can be used in more targeted attacks so, while link removal is an option, an entire takedown would be safest.

**Do you have the alleged infringer's contact information? If so, please provide it:**  
Github user christinegp. Primary e-mail address [private]
