*Infringement* 

The whole project was forked here @ https://github.com/favormm/ECGWavesPlayer, and I have contacted the user through email to request remove the project but no response at all.
I have checked the forked project that it is 100% of the original project without any modification, and I wish the user should remove the whole project.
