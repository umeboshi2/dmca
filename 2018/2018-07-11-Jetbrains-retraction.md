Hello!

I am very sorry, but I am afraid that four of several dozens repositories recently reported as
infringing JetBrains' rights were misdetected as infringing.

It relates to this DMCA claim: https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2018/2018-07-05-Jetbrains.md

Misdetected repostories are:

https://github.com/elgohr/cf-jetbrains-license-server  
https://github.com/foundations/cf-jetbrains-license-server   
https://github.com/llimon/cf-jetbrains-license-server  
https://github.com/aritraghoshdastidar/cf-jetbrains-license-server  

Could you please reinstate them? We were contacted by the owner of one of the repositories and were
given more details about the nature of the code there.  
I appreciate if you help me with this as soon as you can. I am very sorry for the inconvenience.
