Hi [private] and Support team,

My name is [private], and I am [private]. I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. Harvey Nash Vietnam is the software outsourcing company, which eCargo is one of our current running project.

It came to my attention that source code of Harvey Nash's eCargo project is published in multiple public GitHub repositories. The unauthorized and infringing copies can be found at the following public repositories:  
https://github.com/teerstudio/FULL  
https://github.com/teerstudio/Android  
https://github.com/teerstudio/SWIFT-_IOS_ECOM  

This letter is an official notification under the provisions of Section 512(c) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") to effect removal of the above-reported infringement(s).

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Best regards,

[private]
