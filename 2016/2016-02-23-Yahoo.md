DMCA Agent,

I write to submit a DMCA notice to GitHub.  As a preliminary matter, I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

The infringing content can be found at the following location and includes the entire repository under the folder handoff_tool_v2:

https://github.com/sphurtidixit/handoff_tool_v2/tree/master/htdocs

The files contained in this repository comprise a work that is owned by Yahoo, and, moreover, is not made available to the general public.

I'm requesting that GitHub delete this work, including, if any exist, forks to this repository.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Should you have any questions, please contact me.

I appreciate your immediate attention to Yahoo's DMCA notice.

Sincerely,

[Private]
