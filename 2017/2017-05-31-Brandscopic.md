**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No. These are not open source, but were developed as proprietary to Brandscopic as part of their contractor agreements.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**

All content is our Intellectual Property and should be removed.

**Do you have the alleged infringer's contact information? If so, please provide it:**

We cannot tell from the username's who these user's over. We believe "ryoalstar" is a developer with real name [private] from [private] who worked with us until February 2016. We are unsure on the "Kenikeda" user's true identity.
