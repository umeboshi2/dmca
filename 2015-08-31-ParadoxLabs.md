To whom it may concern:

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to filing a DMCA Notice.

ParadoxLabs develops, maintains and sells an extension for use with the
Magento Commerce Platform. The users below have forked a codebase that
includes our commercial extension. We do not believe this is a malicious
attempt to distribute our extension; we believe the users simply didn't
realize that their actions could result in individuals downloading our
extension without purchasing it.

The accounts and code paths in question are:

https://github.com/itmyprofession

https://github.com/itmyprofession/magentowithextension/tree/master/app/code/community/ParadoxLabs/AuthorizeNetCim

https://github.com/myjavawork

https://github.com/myjavawork/juvenile/tree/master/app/code/community/ParadoxLabs/AuthorizeNetCim

https://github.com/spanakorizo

https://github.com/spanakorizo/juvenile/tree/master/app/code/community/ParadoxLabs/AuthorizeNetCim

To remedy the copyright issue, the users will need to make the repository
private.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described
above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner,
or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification
is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on
behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

I do not have contact information for any of the accounts listed.

You may contact me at:

Thank you for your help rectifying this situation.
