DMCA Take Down Notice

To GitHub Inc.:

I am the copyright owner of files being infringed at:  
https://github.com/GhostTomX/SerVlet-JSP

This letter is official notification under the provisions of Section 512(c) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") to effect removal of the above-reported infringements. I request that you immediately issue a cancellation message as specified in RFC 1036 for the specified postings. Please be advised that law requires you, as a service provider, to "expeditiously remove or disable access to" the infringing material upon receiving this notice. Noncompliance may result in a loss of immunity for liability under the DMCA.

As shown in the bottom of the web page of this GitHub link (https://github.com/GhostTomX/SerVlet-JSP), it is also clearly written that "[private]", which in English means [private] is the copyright holder of those PDF files. That sentence also has a hyperlink linking to my professional web page at National Taiwan University (So, GhostTomX, the owner of this GitHub page, also has acknowledged that those files are my teaching materials in PDF format). However, GhostTomX did not have my permission to have my teaching materials shared in public. [private]

As aforementioned, the infringing materials are my teaching materials, which are not publicly published online so that there is no URL link to access the materials. Specifically, the infringing materials on this GitHub link (https://github.com/GhostTomX/SerVlet-JSP) are: Class 1.pdf, Class 2.pdf, Class 3-1.pdf, Class 3-2.pdf, Class 4-1.pdf, Class 5.pdf, Class 6.pdf, Class 7-1.pdf, Class 7-2.pdf, Class 8-1.pdf, Class 8-2.pdf, Class 9.pdf, Class 10-1.pdf, Class 10-2.pdf, Class 11.pdf, Class 12.pdf, Class 13.pdf, Homework4-2_Practice.war, TagLibraryPractice.war, 作I一.pdf, 作I二.pdf, 作I三.pdf.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration. I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Sincerely,

[private]
