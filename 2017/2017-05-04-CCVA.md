my entire project is under GPLv3, but this man removed the license after he forked mine and [Private]' s work.
Also, he wrote "thanks to [Private] and [Private] for the IDEA ..." but we provided him code, and he used it in his repo, is not just an idea.
He deleted the note "copyright 2016 [Private] and [Private]" too from the readme.

add the license back and include our names (BurningHam and cttynull) in the readme file under a copyright section.
