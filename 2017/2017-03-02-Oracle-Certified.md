I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. I am one of the authors of the Oracle Certified Associate Java Programmer Study Guide. It has come to my attention that a user is illegally hosting a copy of the book, file name "Oracle Certified Associate Java SE 8 Programmer I Study Guide Exam 1Z0-808.pdf" on github at:

https://github.com/Himansu-Nayak/ebooks

The book is on sale at Amazon at http://www.amazon.com/OCA-Certified-Associate-Programmer-1Z0-808/dp/1118957407 and the copyright is held by the publisher (Wiley). I am authorized to speak about copyright infringement and I have included a member of the publishing staff, [Private], on this email thread.

Looking through the repository, not only does it contain our book but the books of many other published authors. It is with this belief we feel the entire repository should be taken down. This is clearly a pirate dump repository. There are many forks that contain the same copyrighted material:

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Thank you,
