I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

The entire repository with copyright code has been illegally added:  
https://github.com/Inspireddev10/fomo-ios

I am [private] of FOMO Rocks Ltd, NZ registered company:  
https://nzcompany.org/co.php?id=5611745

We host our code on Bitbucket and have never hosted any code on Github.
Attached is our Bitbucket repository screenshot.

This [private] has no affiliation with myself, the company or any of our
development staff. The readme also clearly shows I am being blackmailed
(attached for your viewing).

The entire repository and all code must be removed immediately and not be
allowed to be relisted without my express permission.

This user is not to be provided with my personal details as I believe they
will use them to attempt more blackmail opportunities.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described
above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner,
or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this
notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am
authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is
allegedly infringed.
