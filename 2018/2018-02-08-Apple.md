Dear [private] and/or GitHub Copyright Agent:  
  
I, the undersigned, state UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY that:  
  
[1] I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice;  
  
[2] I am a person injured, or an agent authorized to act on behalf of a person injured by a violation of the U.S. Copyright laws, in particular Section 501 of Title 17 of the United States Code, commonly referred to as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, or "DMCA";

[4] I have a good faith belief that the files in the forked repositories identified below (by URL) are unlawful under these laws because, among other things, the files offer to distribute a copyrighted item without authorization from the owner of the copyright.  
  
[5] Reason:  
  
Content Type:  
  
Reproduction of Apple's "iBoot" source code, which is responsible for ensuring trusted boot operation of Apple's iOS software. The "iBoot" source code is proprietary and it includes Apple's copyright notice. It is not open-source.  
  
Violation(s):  
  
Copyright Infringement  
  
[6] Please act expeditiously to disable the content found at the following forked repositories;  
  
https://github.com/aaomidi/iBoot  
https://github.com/anitricks/iBoot  
https://github.com/antonyho/iBoot  
https://github.com/argp/iBoot  
https://github.com/Ayrx/iBoot

https://github.com/datag00n/iBoot  
https://github.com/dev-excelerus/iBoot  
https://github.com/dunderhay/iBoot  
  
Furthermore, based on the representative number of forks we have reviewed, we believe that all or most of the forks in this network are infringing to the same extent as the parent repository (ZioShiba/iBoot). Accordingly, and because there are a growing number of forks that contain the infringing content at issue, we respectfully request that GitHub disable the entire network.  
  
[7] I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration; and  
  
[8] I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.  
  
Thank you for your kind assistance.  
  
Truthfully,  
  
[private]
