I have read, and understand, GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

*Identify the copyrighted work you believe has been infringed.*  
This work was originally hosted on  
https://github.com/winifix/PixelMagic and  
https://github.com/winifix/PixelMagicCR and  
https://github.com/winifix/PixelMagic-OpenSource

The source was originally hosted open-source [which I have no issue with
the user forking] here is a fork of that version: 
https://github.com/WowDevs/PixelMagic-OpenSource

*Identify the material that you allege is infringing the copyrighted work
listed in item*  
https://github.com/Scottishdwarf/PixelMagic

*Why I took the project down?* Because it was reported by me to
[private] and I said I would take down all botting sources, which
I have since done.

Please also take down these repositories which are from leaked/reversed
source
https://github.com/Scottishdwarf/CloudMagicBin this is an obvious clone of  
https://github.com/winifix/PixelMagic  
https://github.com/PCSorcerer/CloudMagicBin  
https://github.com/hamuel89/CloudMagicBin  
and the actual reversed source  

https://github.com/Scottishdwarf/CloudMagic 
Clear issues are  
https://github.com/Scottishdwarf/CloudMagic/blob/master/LUA/Addon.lua  
which is a clone of the original LUA from  
https://github.com/winifix/PixelMagic  
and the rest of the CS files are simply renamed to CloadMagic where needed
and a new false license agreement applied.

*Explain what the affected user would need to do in order to remedy the
infringement.*  
I explained to him via an Issue I raised on the project, he is welcome to
clone the original open-source project here:
https://github.com/WowDevs/PixelMagic-OpenSource
but not the closed-source one.

*Provide your contact information.*  
email address: [private] or [private]  
name: [private]  
Telephone Number: [private]  
Physical address:  
[private]

*Provide contact information, if you know it, for the alleged infringer*

All I know is the GitHub names: Scottishdwarf & PCSorcerer & hamuel89  

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described
above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner,
or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.
I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this
notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am
authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is
allegedly infringed.
