Hello GitHub,

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

Github user tchret has posted several infringing files to the repository:
http://github.com/tchret/hubum/blob/master/app/assets/fonts

The Atlas fonts in the “atlas.zip" file and “atlas" directory are commercial font software copyrighted by Schwartzco, Inc., d/b/a Commercial Type.
The fonts can be viewed on our website at http://commercialtype.com/catalog/atlas/atlas_typewriter

The user does not have a license for the font software, has illegally modified the font software, and is unresponsive to email.
We ask that you please remove all files in the /fonts directory.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.
I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Best regards,
[private]
