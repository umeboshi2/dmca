Hello,
My Name is [private], I am working at the legal Department of TeamSpeak Systems GmbH, Soiernstr. [private]. I am authorized to act on the Copyright ownerÂ´s behalf.

You can find our Software at our Homepage http://teamspeak.com/  
We distribute worldwide voice conferencing software that allows users to communicate and exchange files via the Internet via voice and text. It is optimized for use in parallel to so-called online games. The distributed software has been well established on the market for years. The use is made in such a way that the corresponding software is provided by one of the so-called commercial-hosting companies by them and then individual subscribers, consumers, by downloading a "client" for a fee via those of the self-employed commercially available connected servers. For the provision of the server licenses, a fee is paid by the professional to TeamSpeak according to the extent of use.  

TeamSpeak Systems GmbH is exclusively entitled to the copyrights and title rights to the software developed and distributed by it and its name, Teamspeak.  

Via the link https://github.com/TeaSpeak/TS3-Patch-plugin a TeamSpeak 3 plugin is offered, which is an illegal non-functional copy of our software. It will violate copyright, company and title rights.  

We will notify you of these violations and ask you to remove the link.  

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.  

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

I confirm that I have read the Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice: https://help.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/**
