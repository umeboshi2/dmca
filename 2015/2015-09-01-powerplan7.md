Hello,  

I'm the copyright holder for the Trackpad++ software (http://trackpad.powerplan7.com)

Unfortunately our software got affected by a keygen, openly published
at GitHub (at https://github.com/lktiep/TrackpadPlusKeygen)

GitHub Terms of Service (A.8) are clearly violated, and, more
importantly, an international copyright law. We had given NO permission
to a third party (including GitHub user account 'lktiep') to reverse
engineer our software and generate/distribute the tools for assigning
the License Keys (Donator's S/Ns) for our software. Please note that the
author of the keygen himself does clearly state, it is THE KEYGEN. May I
kindly raise the question, since when GitHub is openly hosting the
keygens and/or cracks?

Please let me briefly describe the mechanism of circumvention: 
- Our Trackpad++ software is a kind of donationware which requires
mandatory weekly updates unless the user is a donator; 
- We assign the Donator's S/N keys only to project supporters, and
once entered, the Donator's S/N disables the mandatory weekly redownload
feature; 
- This mechanism, Donator's S/N for permanent uninterrupted usage is
the way our project is being funded. 
- The keygen not only breaks our licensing scheme/EULA by allowing all
people to get the S/N assigned, but also features the reverse engineered
code, and directly steals the copyrighted intellectual property from the
owner. IT'S THE KEYGEN, IT'S THAT SIMPLE, AND ITS AUTHOR ALREADY
CONFIRMED THIS IN HIS OWN DESCRIPTION, SO PLEASE COSIDER IT FOR REMOVING
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. 

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. I
have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described
above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright
owner, or its agent, or the law. I swear, under penalty of perjury, that
the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the
copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an
exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. 

Thank You,
