**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  
Yes. I haven't found forks of this repository.  

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**  
No. The work is licensed under a closed source license.  

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**  
He should remove the EVP5 folder and all its contents from the repository and from the entire project's history, for all the repositories containing it.  
A quick look at the other contents of the repository shows that more commercial Unity Assets are being included in the published projects. Maybe it would be better for this user to learn that he cannot post public projects that contain commercial assets, as these are always copyrighted work under closed source license.
