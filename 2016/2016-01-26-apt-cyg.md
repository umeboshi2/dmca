I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

I own the copyright to a signifcant portion of the code on this
repository, namely:

http://github.com/transcode-open/apt-cyg/blob/master/apt-cyg

According to the blame:

http://github.com/transcode-open/apt-cyg/blame/master/apt-cyg

I own 635/673 lines, or 94% of the code. I am fine with the repository
staying open but I would like this file removed or my code redacted.
This code was removed from my control by hostile user "transcode-open"
and he is now hosting it without my permission.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials
described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the
copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this
notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am
authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that
is allegedly infringed.
