Hello,

I have an urgent DMCA takedown notice to submit. I believe this was done by a rogue former contractor who had previously extortedâ€‹ us with a threat of doing this.

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

The copyrighted work that has been infringed is the source code for the product (Turing Email) that my company (Turing Technology, Inc.) has built.

This repository https://github.com/iamrubyguru/tu is infringing upon my company's copyright by posting the entire source code for the product without permission.

The only thing the affected user could do to remedy the infringement is to remove the entire contents of the repository (i.e. all of our source code and commit history, etc).

Here is my contact information:

I do not know any contact information of the alleged infringer other than: https://github.com/iamrubyguru

"I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Here is my electronic signature:

Best,
