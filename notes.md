What is Happening?
On 22nd of January, 2013 Envato updated their licenses and it is no longer possible to use items from marketplaces within your own items that will be for sale on Envato marketplaces, without a partnership agreement between two authors. In this case between me (Michael M) and you (Envato author).
Important: "In Stock" license is available only if you theme is sold on ThemeForest exclusively.

In-Stock Usage License
The good news are that we can still work together and make this world better. I've created online form, where you can transform your "Extended license" to the "In Stock" usage license.
Important: That separate "In Stock" license is required for each of your themes that are for sale on ThemeForest.
 
How to Get In-Stock License?
Head over to the Visual Composer's page and obtain "Extended license"
Then fill out this form and my permission will be emailed to your email address
Last, but not least. Please consider adding an attribution link to my Visual Composer in your item's description page

What's Next?
Now, you should follow the Visual Composer Theme Integration instructions to integrate plugin into your theme.
Thank you once again!
Michael M, WPBakery

"WordPress platform is licensed under the General Public License (GPL). Nevertheless Visual Composer, same as other plugins on Envato Market, is sold under a default split license. This means authors can protect their rights and freedoms to respect (and comply with) the GPL as well as to control their own work.
While part of plugin coded with PHP goes under GPL license, all Javascript and CSS is not GPL, which in general restricts using Visual Composer under terms of GPL. Please read more about Split License at Envato.
