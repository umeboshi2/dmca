Dear Copyright Agent:

I, the undersigned, state UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY that:

I am an agent authorized to act on behalf of a person injured by a
violation of the U.S. Copyright laws, in particular section(s) 1201(a)(2)
and/or 1201(b)(1) of Title 17 of the United States Code, commonly referred
to as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, or "DMCA";

I May Be Contacted At:    
Name of Injured Party: TestDome Limited    
Name: [private]  
Address: [private]    
Company: TestDome Limited    
Email address: [private]

I have a good faith belief that the source code snippets identified below
(by URL) are unlawful under these laws because, among other things, they
breach the copyright clause of TestDome's Terms of Service:

Reason:  
Original content, including any solutions to original testing content are
owned by TestDome Limited and are available only to our paying customers.  

Files found online are our (TestDome) templates for candidates to implement
their solutions in so original authorship is split for all files. But, as
candidates agree to our Terms of service
<https://www.testdome.com/terms> before
taking a test where they assign ownership of their solutions to us
(TestDome). Excerpt:

allegedly infringed.
