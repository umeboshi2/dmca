To Whom It May Concern,  
After working with the author of the repository who I intitally felt was infringing on my rights, I am
retracting my claim after realizing I am in the wrong.  
Please restore the following repository:  
https://github.com/SubstituteCS/Borderless-Gaming/releases/tag/9.2  
Thank you,
