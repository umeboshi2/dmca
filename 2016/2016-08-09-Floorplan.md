https://github.com/guitao/Floorplan

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  
NO.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**  
I have noticed this rule: “Deleting a public repository will not delete its forks.”

Actually, I have made a mistake to submit code to github that SHOULD NOT BE PUBLIC.
and this guy might fork it at that time.
So even if i delete the repository, the code is still open to the public.
I have received warning from my company, and things could not be even worse.
Please help!

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**  
NO. I notice my first commit is the only commit in this forked repo.

**Do you have the alleged infringer's contact information? If so, please provide it:**  
Actually the code belong to my company. And I have made a mistake to submit it into public repo in GitHub. U can find more details in readme.md.
