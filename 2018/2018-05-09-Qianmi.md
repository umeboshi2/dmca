Dear Github DMCA Agent:

We recently learned that a few GitHub users have posted proprietary and confidential Qianmi owned copyrighted materials (software code) to your site and write for assistance as follows:

Please remove all of the following infringing files and folders that contain Qianmi materials at these locatio (specific URLs) pursuant to this notice submitted under Github’s DMCA policies:

https://github.com/Hokok/store

https://github.com/mygithuball/hzyys-ks/tree/0906-market-label-feature/yys_code

https://github.com/xie-summer/sunder-repository/tree/f1c7940aa5cceb1155324e35b32ff42165346097/%E7%94%B5%E5%95%86-app-platform

https://github.com/wanghaitao1988/yangyanshu-platform

https://github.com/mygithuball/hzyys-platform/tree/0802-APP-template-feature/yangyanshu-platform

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. I have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright or intellectual property owner, its agent, or the law. I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the above information is accurate and that I am authorized to act on the copyright or intellectual property owner's behalf.

We appreciate your assistance as we investigate the activities that lead to the unauthorized posting of Qianmi’s materials.

In addition, In the process of the company’s subsequent maintenance of its own legitimate rights and interests, it may be necessary for the Github community to assist in providing relevant non-open source code upload records and detailed information of illegal uploaders, hoping that the Github community can provide that for our company as much information as possible. Thank you very much!
