I have not searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories. If there are other infringing forks of this work, we wish to have them taken down.

The work not previously licensed under an open source license and the infringing files are not being used under an open source license.

We request the immediate take-down and cease of all future unlicensed use of the image.

I do not have the alleged infringer's contact information.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
