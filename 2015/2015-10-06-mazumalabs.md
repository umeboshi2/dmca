Hi Github,

I've sadly been dealing with a contracting situation that has gone awry and
the other party has now maliciously publicized copyrighted material. They
have taken my company's entire source code and publicized it at the
following link. There have since been forks of this repository which
include copyrighted material which we request take-down of as well:

- Original Repository:
https://github.com/BlueSilver0702/Portfolio___Finance-News-and-Stock-Tracker
- Forked Repository:
https://github.com/lubieapki/Portfolio___Finance-News-and-Stock-Tracker

You can clearly see from the source itself that I am the author and it is
copyright Mazuma Labs, Inc -- of which, I am the [private]. Source:
https://github.com/BlueSilver0702/Portfolio___Finance-News-and-Stock-Tracker/blob/master/Portfolio/MonetizationPromptViewController.h

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. I have
a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above
on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or
its agent, or the law. I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the
information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright
owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive
right that is allegedly infringed.

This entire repository needs to be removed and taken down. I don't believe
the user will comply as they have ill-intent.

My contact information is below.

Thank you,
