Hi, master:

I’m slua author, I’m [private].

I received the DMCA notice , https://github.com/pangweiwei/slua

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Counter Notice.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.

The truth is :

The ulua author [private] told me I stolen his code in my early version of slua(my project), he pointed out below code is his copyrights:

[redacted]

But all top codes came from LuaMonoInterface(it’s MIT opensource), original codes are here https://github.com/stevedonovan/MonoLuaInterface/blob/master/src/luastdcall.c, you will see all 4 functions are same to LuaMonoInterface,  I just made a mistake to copy a wrong copyrights HEADER from ulua’s file, I have to admit I read ulua’s code, I thought that copyrights HEAD is original came from LuaMonoInterface, so I remain them in my code.

Except top codes , any other 99.9% slua’s code is my right and owned by myself, I don’t know why Github takendown my project .

I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located  Northern District of California  and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.
