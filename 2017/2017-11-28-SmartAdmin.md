I am the [private] of SmartAdmin WebApp. I have built this webapp from scratch to be sold exclusively on   
 
wrapbootstrap.com. It has been selling for over 3 years. If anyone is giving them out for free (which is not allowed   
 
under any of the licenses) then it is affecting my sales and business. I have found full copies of SmartAdmin sitting   
 
on public a repository, this is strictly not allowed under any circumstances. Each day these assets sits on a public   
 
repository I am having business loss.   
 
Provide information on which GitHub may contact you, including your email address, name, telephone   
 
number and physical address.
