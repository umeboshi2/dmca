I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.
I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
We hereby ask Github to remove this source code away from public distribution asap.
Below is the information you ask for on your home page in such a copyright case:

The code which is uploaded to Github.com was written in a Capgemini ‘Omega’ project for an important Client (PRIVATE) . It was the Client (PRIVATE) who discovered the copyrighted work that has been infringed upon.
I enclose the email from client below to document this:

 Subject: Omega source code on Github
Hi guys,
I was browsing around the github and searched code with ”[private]” and bumped into this: https://github.com/vaswin/JavaUtilities/tree/JavaUtilities/Omegaws/ws
This includes a snapshot of Omega project’s source code (the not-so-successful Capgemini project), and I think this should not naturally be publicly available… Is the source code of Omega owned by [private] or Capgemini?
I think both Github and the user should be contacted to get this source code away from public distribution.
