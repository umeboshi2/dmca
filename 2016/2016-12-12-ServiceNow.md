I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

The following site https://github.com/samhart/bliffoscope has posted an interview question and solution which is owned by ServiceNow. The entire repository is in breach of our copyrighted material which is owned by ServiceNow.

We request the entire repository is removed.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Cheers

Cheers
