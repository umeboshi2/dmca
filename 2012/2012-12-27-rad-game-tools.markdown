To whom it may concern:

I am writing to request that you remove portions of copyrighted code that is posted upon your site at the 
address: 

https://github.com/Dhelayan/plLayerBink

The code in question references RAD Game Tools’ copyrighted code (copyright 1997-2012) for using our 
Bink video codec SDK. 

A bit of background: Cyan Worlds release their Myst engine as open source in 2011. Cyan Worlds had 
been a Bink licensee for the original, non-open source Myst, however, they erred when they released, and 
accidentally included sample code for using Bink, which was copied almost verbatim from the Bink SDK 
help file. Cyan World’s license specifically prohibited them from releasing this code. When we at RAD 
discovered this breach in December, 2012, we contacted Cyan, who in turn reached out to their open source 
community and asked everyone to remove the infringing material. Almost everyone in the community did 
their best to honor RAD’s copyrights, but in monitoring the conversation at 

http://forums.openuru.org/viewtopic.php?f=91&t=848&start=50 

I discovered that one user in particular has posted the material at GitHub, and also noted on his page there: 

“plLayerBink 

You remove it, i add it.” 

Therefore we at RAD Game Tools, Inc., owner of the copyrighted software in question, ask that you 
remove the code. I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the 
infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. 

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the 
copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that ls allegedly 
infringed. 

I can be reached at the number on this sheet, or at [private]. 

Thanks for your help,
