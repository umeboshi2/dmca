[7] Where can Apple's original work be seen: Apple's internal workflow

[8] I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, owner of the confidential information, or its agent, or the law.

[9] I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Thank you for your kind assistance.

Truthfully,
