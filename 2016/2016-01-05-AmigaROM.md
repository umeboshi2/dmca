We received, and verified, a piracy report for these repositories:

https://github.com/stagas/amigaos  
https://github.com/pusparajm/amigaos  
https://github.com/montegobay/amigaos  

These were forked from the previously reported https://github.com/amigasource/amigaos.

Under penalty of perjury I declare that the above repositories (three forks and their source repository), include a pirate copy of our copyrighted Amiga ROM and operating system software. US copyrights that are infringed upon include V3604D715 and V3626D795. This is also infringing on our US registered trademark 3946885.

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

May anyone who reads this have a wonderful continuation of 2016.

Regards,
