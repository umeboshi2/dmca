Infringement Notice

Dear Sirs/Madams,

We have been notified that licence keys, binary code and source code of license server serving
licenses to products of our company JetBrains s.r.o. (such as
Upsource, PhpStorm, WebStorm, PyCharm, RubyMine, IntelliJ IDEA, AppCode, ReSharper, CLion,
DataGrip), the URLs of the illegally run license servers,
cracks (software which intentionally and illegally modifies JetBrains tools in order to run it on
behalf of a third party without an authorization from JetBrains)
and instructions on how to use the cracks are publicly accessible on your website github.com.

Some of the infringing materials contain a disclaimer which says that the materials do not have a
private key, and thus are not truly infringing. Please note that such claim is a forgery, because
private keys are easy to find in the Internet, as well as at GitHub in other repositories. Thus, we
ask to remove all the materials which can be used to build a software which violates JetBrains
rights by generating illicit activation codes, regardless of how many repositories the source codes
are distributed among.

JetBrains s.r.o. is an owner of registered trademarks for all of the products specified above, those
are proprietary desktop software products.

The materials infringing JetBrains s.r.o. rights mentioned above are to be found in particular on
the following links:

https://github.com/aldslvda/blog-images/blob/master/idea_crack.png  

Because:  
1) you and github.com users owning repositories / gists mentioned above are not the owners of the
trademarks of these products and  
2) you and github.com users owning repositories / gists mentioned above do not have any agreement
with our company which would entitle you or them to redistribute our products, license keys or
license keys generators for our products,  

we consider the occurrence of cracks, license keys, license keys generators to our products, license
servers
source and binary code, and URLs of license servers which are not authorized by JetBrains to distribute
licenses to our products on the website github.com to be infringement of our proprietary rights.  

ThatÂ´s why we demand that you:  
1) immediately cease all use of our trademarks by the links specified above,  
2) immediately remove all cracks, license keys, source code of license keys generators, license servers
source code, and URLs of license servers which are not authorized by JetBrains to distribute
licenses to our products and any other references to our products from the website github.com, by
the links specified above,  
3) forbear from all further unauthorised use of our trademarks and from all further making
accessible of license keys to our products, as well as source code of license keys generating software.  

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing
web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I
am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that
is allegedly infringed.
