**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Working for Bundesagentur fuer Arbeit, a federal Government agency, I act as [Private]. The github account "inaxium" belongs to one of our developers, [Private].

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The software was fully paid by our department in this agency and is not meant to be publically available any where at any time. The repository alleged infringing our copyrights is this:

https://github.com/inaxium/tec4

Please take down the entire repository immediatly.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository's URL:**

https://github.com/inaxium/tec4

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

There appears to be no forks or copies yet. A swift search came back only showing this repo by now.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

There is no open source license to it -- this software is meant to be proprietary and totally owned by the federal Government's agency, Bundesagentur fuer Arbeit, Regensburger Strasse 104, Nuremberg.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**

Taking it down right now it the only option to us.

**Do you have the alleged infringer's contact information? If so, please provide it:**
