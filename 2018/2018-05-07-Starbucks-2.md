To whom it may concern:  

I have read and understand GitHubâ€™s Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. We believe all of the files, sub-files and code contained within the following repository:  

* https://github.com/baldyrocks/azuredeepdive  

Belongs to Starbucks under our intellectual property agreement we have with each employee, vendor and contingent worker. This includes all code, files and sub-files within repositories.  

As stated per our agreement with each employee, vendor and contingent worker, no Starbucks intellectual property may be used or shared without the specific consent from Starbucks to do so. Further, Starbucks does not grant any license exceptions to this policy and the aforementioned data must be deleted immediately.  

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent or the law.  
I have taken fair use into consideration. I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.  

Sincerely,
