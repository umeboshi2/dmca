I have investigated each individual case and I have noticed that the
projects listed above are using source code copied from the project
https://github.com/tecnickcom/TCPDF originally hosted at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/tcpdf/ but all original notices about
author, copyright and license were removed or replaced.

The first commit on the PARENT project is indicated as 7 September
2013, so it can be safely compared against TCPDF version 6.0.025
released 4 September 2013
(https://github.com/tecnickcom/TCPDF/tree/6.0.025):

In the PARENT and FORKS1 projects the following files appears to be
almost verbatim copies of the original ones, with the exception of the
legal notices removed (author, copyright and license):

* src/Dinesh/Barcode/Datamatrix.php (include/barcodes/datamatrix.php)
* src/Dinesh/Barcode/DNS1D.php (tcpdf_barcodes_1d.php)
* src/Dinesh/Barcode/DNS2D.php (tcpdf_barcodes_2d.php)
* src/Dinesh/Barcode/PDF417.php (include/barcodes/pdf417.php)
* src/Dinesh/Barcode/QRcode.php (include/barcodes/qrcode.php)

In the FORKS2 project the following files appears to be almost
verbatim copies of the original ones, with the exception of the legal
notices removed (author, copyright and license):

* src/tklovett/barcodes/Barcode.php
* src/tklovett/barcodes/BarcodeGenerator.php
* src/tklovett/barcodes/BarcodeType.php
* src/tklovett/barcodes/OneDimensionalBarcode.php
* src/tklovett/barcodes/TwoDimensionalBarcode.php

The original code is released under the GNU LGPLv3 license and
copyrighted by [Private] - Tecnick.com LTD, but none of this
information is present in the copied files.
https://github.com/tecnickcom/TCPDF/blob/6.0.025/LICENSE.TXT

The options to remedy the infringement are:

1. delete the project - this seems the best option as this project is
not adding anything to the original files.
2. if the license is compatible with GNU-LGPLv3, replace the
infringing files with the original ones, or reinstate the original
notices (author, copyright, license);
3. delete the infringing files and use the new external library
https://github.com/tecnickcom/tc-lib-barcode (originally based on the
same code).

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials
described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the
copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.
I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this
notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am
authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that
is allegedly infringed.

The only contact information I have about the infringers is the one
derived from their GitHub page (please see the preceding links above).

Please send me a prompt response indicating the actions you have taken
to resolve this matter as soon as possible.
