Hello,

My name is [private], and I am the [private] of More Mountains, the copyright owner of the Corgi Engine. I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

I May Be Contacted At:

Name of IP Owner: More Mountains  
Name and Title: [private]  
Company: More Mountains     
Address: [private]  
Email: [private]    
Telephone: [private]    

I’m the [private] of the Corgi Engine, an asset on sale on Unity’s Asset Store : https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/26617

I have a good faith belief that the following repositories/folders :

https://github.com/Dwarfius/MobPlatformer/tree/9740b0f7aa6080de19e260a0d80c671cdb5fd6cb/Assets/2DPlugin     https://github.com/duvi920/NetworkCorgie/tree/master/CogieEngine_Network/Assets/CorgiEngine       https://github.com/JayUnity3d/2DEssentialsPack/tree/master/Assets/CorgiEngine   https://github.com/diegodorado/jekyll_and_hyde/tree/master/Assets/CorgiEngine   https://github.com/Bloodimir/GitHub/tree/master/F%C4%B1rlama/Assets/CorgiEngine  
https://github.com/Greemjoy/purpleHaze/  
https://github.com/anningwithv/2dplatformer/tree/master/Assets/3dAssets/CorgiEngine    https://github.com/JanganCircles/Blade_of_justice/tree/master/ProjectGame/Assets/CorgiEngine   https://github.com/rahul1228/UNITY_Projects/tree/25cb236ad9635d56d4f4ec7e0f5b7d46b17f1704/Corgi%20Platformwe/Assets/PHS/scripts  

offer publicly the contents (code, sounds, visual assets…) of my asset, and that content shouldn't be published anywhere, as it violates Asset Store Terms of Service and EULA (http://unity3d.com/ru/legal/as_terms), APPENDIX 1, sections 5 & 9 and my own copyrights. I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

I have created issues in these repositories, or tried contacting their author, but haven’t received any response. Please remove these repositories or turn them private, so that the proprietor of this site discontinues its criminal activities.

Thank you,  
[private]
