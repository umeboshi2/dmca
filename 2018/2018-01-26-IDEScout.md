Dear GitHub staff,

My name is [private], I am [private] of IDEScout, Inc, http://www.idescout.com/ . IDEScout, Inc. is a registered California software company. We develop and own the copyright product, SQLScout which can be downloaded from https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8322-sqlscout-sqlite-support- . We post each release on Google+ at [private].

Our team has discovered multiple infringements on our product SQLScout and these infringements are hosted on GitHub site. The violations are forked out from one source,
https://github.com/wangjiegulu/wangjiegulu.github.com/commit/d036e7f0f1e5b3bcfa6ccb031bcd275d99eeaf8d , with the username [private], wangjiegulu.

[private] has violated our license contract, http://www.idescout.com/license/ through reverse-engineering the code and bypassing the license check to illegally use our software product for free. This is a breach of our license and product contract which is publicly published on our official website. This contract is guarded by the laws of the State of California, and the United States Copyright Law and the International Treaty provisions.

On the GitHub site, [private] boldly states “SQLScout 2.0.8 (for Android Studio 2.3.) 破解” (Chinese “破解” in English means “Cracked” per Google translator. We also have our native Chinese speaking employee confirmed the correctness of the translation.) and his followers have made comments on his site to ask for the cracked code for our new releases in order to use our product for free continuously, “Please Make new hack for Version: 3.0.0 #17” is one of their issues’ subject
https://github.com/wangjiegulu/wangjiegulu.github.com/issues .

[private]’s violation has also been reported by one of our Google+ followers, [private] ([private] per Google translator) on Google+. [private] also emailed support at idescout.com for the related link information.

[private]’s violation of IP are rampant through GitHub and beyond. GitHub users have forked this repository multiple times.

In summary, we list the allegedly infringing source and its fork as below:
