Dear Sir or Madam:

LookingGlass is authorized to act on behalf of Comcast in requesting removal of its copyrighted works from Internet sites. Under the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 512) and other applicable U.S. and international statutes, LookingGlass provides this notification of claimed infringement and requests that you immediately remove certain documents from your web site and/or disable access to those documents through your web site.

LookingGlass has recently discovered the unauthorized publication, disclosure, and copying of highly sensitive, confidential, trade secret, and copyright-protected documents on the below web site. Specifically, we have confirmed that the documents whose locations and filenames identified at

https://github.com/iris-platform/iris-android-sdk-snapshot/blob/991d82553fff7456c18ee9bae2cea7db55fd8d6b/app_old/src/main/res/values/strings.xml  
https://github.com/iris-platform/iris-android-sdk-snapshot/blob/991d82553fff7456c18ee9bae2cea7db55fd8d6b/app_old/src/main/java/net/comcast/xfinityvideoshare/CIMALogin.java  
https://github.com/iris-platform/iris-android-sdk-snapshot/blob/964645acf263cda9011c308fe737b4fb712fb4a3/IrisReferenceClient/app/src/main/res/values/auth_manager_config.xml

are confidential and proprietary to Comcast and were posted without Comcast’s permission.

The unauthorized copying, disclosure and distribution of Comcast’s confidential trade secret and/or copyright-protected documents constitute a violation of both civil and criminal trade secret and copyright laws.

Based on our preliminary investigation, we believe that this web site is owned and/or controlled by you. LookingGlass, therefore, requests that you (1) remove these documents from any of the web sites under your control and/or disable access to these documents through any of the web sites under your control, and (2) destroy any and all copies of the documents that you possess.

We also request that you identify to us your source(s) for these documents, so that we may contact them and request that they delete and/or remove the documents that they possess as well.

Comcast is the owner of an exclusive copyright for each of these documents. LookingGlass is authorized to act on behalf of Comcast, and has a good faith belief that the publication and/or disclosure by your web site is not authorized by Comcast, any of Comcast’s agents, or the law.

Nothing herein shall constitute a waiver of any of Comcast’s rights in law or in equity, all of which are expressly reserved.
