Dear GitHub

I have talked to @bpinto and his other collaborators and decided to reconcile
and conclude our litigation amicably on the following conditions:

* The license read Copyright (c) 2015 Oh My Fish!
* Add an AUTHORS file with proper copyright attribution.
* @bpinto and @bobthecow go on as admins.
* @scorphus, @derekstavis and @bucaran are now collaborators.
* We swear not to fight over copyright issues again ;)

You may have the DMCA revoked at your earliest convenience.
