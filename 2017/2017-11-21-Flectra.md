**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Original work was located at the https://github.com/flectrahq/flectra

In a mean time while work was in progress, we found out that there was some issue with our code.

A developer mistakenly pushed a properitory code into our repository. In order to avoid any infrindgements, we removed our repository located at https://github.com/flectrahq/flectra and created a new one.

During this, there were some developers who had already forked the code from old repository and now that code is located into their repositories.

In order to avoid any conflicts and infrindgements issues with properitory code owner, we are requesting github.com to help us remove any such repositories which are fork of our OLD code and contains conflicting properitory code.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository's URL:**

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Above mentioned forks are the one we were able to identify as infringing forks. Rest forks does not contain anything objectionable.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

Core code is under the LGPL license, but some of the code was taken from a third party properitory software, which makes it illegal to keep it under open source license.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**

No changes are possible other than removing the repository as a solution.

**Do you have the alleged infringer's contact information? If so, please provide it:**

No, we do not have any contact details for alleged infringer.
