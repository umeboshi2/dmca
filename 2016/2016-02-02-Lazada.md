Dear [private],

My name is [private] and I am the [private] of Lazada. I have read and
understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

We have noted that several Github repositories that your company hosts is
infringing on copyright owned by my company.

The unauthorised and infringing repositories can be found at the following
