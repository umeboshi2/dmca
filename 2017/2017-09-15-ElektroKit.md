**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**  

Yes. Im the unique author and unique propietary of the commercial product/library/project: ElektroKit  

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**  

It lives ONLY in Envato's CodeCanyon marketplace:  
https://codecanyon.net/item/elektrokit-class-library-for-net/19260282  

I don't understand what kind of "detailed description" I should include, but I'll try it: ElektroKit is a framework for .NET developers, it includes user-controls, extension methods and more.  

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository's URL:**  

[disabled in previous takedown]  
https://github.com/ericziko/ElektroKit  
https://github.com/68681395/ElektroKit  
https://github.com/nagyist/ElektroKit  
https://github.com/santaclown/ElektroKit  

Basically all these Forks:
https://github.com/68681395/ElektroKit/network/members

ALL THE FILES OF THE ENTIRE FORKS, WITHOUT EXCEPTION, are exact the same as the original repository, those users didn't added/changed anything.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  

I searched for more forks, but I didn't found anything more than those described above.  

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**  

Not a license, ElektroKit was declared a commercial product, I'm the copyright.  
  
**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**  

The forks should be removed.  

**Do you have the alleged infringer's contact information? If so, please provide it:**  

After a simple research, this is what I found:
