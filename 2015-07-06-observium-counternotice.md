1. I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Counter
Notice.

2. Regarding the contested content at
https://github.com/librenms/librenms/commit/6874d329044b80f028b8dc2b0af067b98be649f4

3. My contact details are as follows:
[private]

4. I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief
that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or
misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.  
  
  I am the author of the disputed commit. The code was not copied from
Observium, nor was any non-GPL-covered Observium code viewed at any time
during the production of the code.  
  
  There are three other near-identical blocks of code in adjacent lines in
the same file
(https://github.com/librenms/librenms/blob/6874d329044b80f028b8dc2b0af067b98be649f4/includes/polling/system.inc.php).
Lines 116-121 are a trivial adaptation of lines 110-115, referencing
'sysObjectID' instead of 'sysContact'.

5. I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the
judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United
States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is
located), and I will accept service of process from the person who
provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.
