Dear GitHub,

I would like to kindly request that you remove or make private the
following code repositories:

https://github.com/ekwalker/CS131P1  
https://github.com/ekwalker/CSE131-2

The above code repositories contain code that is part of a course project
that I developed at the University of California, San Diego, and is
provided to students with a license agreement that allows only
private/individual copies of the code (we explicitly disallow placing the
code somewhere publicly accessible). As such, the public posting of this
code to your site is a copyright violation.

I am unable to email the repository owners directly with this request, as
no contact information is listed in their profiles.

1. I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

2. The copyrighted work is listed in the above repositories.

3. All of the material in the repositories above are under this license
agreement.

4. All of the material must be deleted or set to private visibility.

5. You may contact me at:

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials
described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the
copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this
notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am
authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is
allegedly infringed.

Sincerely,
