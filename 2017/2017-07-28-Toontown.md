Toontown Ultimate Adventure was a closed source game until NotDarchYTP released his leak here https://github.com/NotDarchYTPs/Toontown-Ultimate-Adventure-Leak. This made my entire team freak out, and we have 4 Staff leaves. We just want this gone, because it is running our reputation

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  

There's no forks, and that's a good thing
