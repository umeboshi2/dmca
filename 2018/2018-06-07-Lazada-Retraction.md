Dear Github Team,

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

We refer to our DCMA takedown request listed at https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2018/2018-05-24-Lazada.md, and the counter-notice listed at https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2018/2018-05-31-Lazada-CounterNotice.md ("Counter-Notice").

For clarification, our DMCA takedown was made in good faith to the best of our knowledge, and having reviewed the counter-notice, we would like to retract in part our DCMA takedown request. Please retract the takedown request only for the following repository:
