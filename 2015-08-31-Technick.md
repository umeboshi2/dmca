To whom it may concern,

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

This DMCA takedown is for the following projects hosted on your website:

* https://github.com/dineshrabara/barcodeAll

I have investigated the case and I have noticed that the project
listed above is using source code copied from the project
https://github.com/tecnickcom/TCPDF originally hosted at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/tcpdf/ but all original notices about
author, copyright and license were removed or replaced.

The first commit on the copied PARENT project is indicated as 5 June
2014, so it can be safely compared against TCPDF version 6.0.083
released 29 May 2014
(https://github.com/tecnickcom/TCPDF/tree/6.0.083):

The following files appears to be almost verbatim copies of the
original ones, with the exception of the legal notices removed
(author, copyright and license):

* src/Datamatrix.php (include/barcodes/datamatrix.php)
* src/DNS1D.php (tcpdf_barcodes_1d.php)
* src/DNS2D.php (tcpdf_barcodes_2d.php)
* src/PDF417.php (include/barcodes/pdf417.php)
* src/QRcode.php (include/barcodes/qrcode.php)

The original code is released under the GNU LGPLv3 license and
copyrighted by [Private] - Tecnick.com LTD, but none of this
information is present in the copied files.
https://github.com/tecnickcom/TCPDF/blob/6.0.083/LICENSE.TXT

The options to remedy the infringment are:

1. delete the project - this seems the best option as this project is
not adding anything to the original files.
2. if the license is compatible with GNU-LGPLv3, replace the
infringing files with the original ones, or reinstate the original
notices (author, copyright, license);
3. delete the infringing files and use the new external library
https://github.com/tecnickcom/tc-lib-barcode (originally based on the
same code).

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials
described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the
copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.
I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this
notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am
authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that
is allegedly infringed.

The only contact information I have about the infringers is the one
derived from their GitHub page (please see the preceding links above).

Please send me a prompt response indicating the actions you have taken
to resolve this matter as soon as possible.
