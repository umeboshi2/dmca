My name is [private]. I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. I am the copyright owner of OneUI, a web template which is exclusively sold on Themeforest (themeforest.net) under the following licensing terms:

'The Regular License grants you, the Purchaser a non-exclusive, non-transferrable right to make use of the product that you acquire 
(Product).' and '(d) Your use of the Product is limited to a single application.'

The full license can be found at:
http://themeforest.net/licenses [http://themeforest.net/licenses]

The original template, the 'OneUI - Admin Dashboard Template & UI Framework' is owned by me. I own the exclusive copyrights and the template can be found for sale at:
http://themeforest.net/item/oneui-admin-dashboard-template-ui-framework/11820082 [http://themeforest.net/item/oneui-admin-dashboard-template-ui-framework/11820082]

It came to my attention that source code of OneUI is published in multiple public GitHub repositories. The unauthorized and infringing copies can be found at the following public repositories:

https://github.com/anihy/oneui

https://github.com/rsreimer/oneui

https://github.com/yuexiaoyun/oneui

Each owner should delete the repository to comply with OneUI's license. If an owner has purchased a license copy from Themeforest, then he can keep the repository but must convert it to a private one. Exposing the source code of the template in a public repository violates OneUI's license.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Should you wish to discuss this with me please contact me directly.

Thank you.
