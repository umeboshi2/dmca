__Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?__

Yes, the maps have been made and are owned by me.

__What work was allegedly infringed? If possible, please provide a URL:__

Inside the following repository, there are multiple maps made and owned by myself. 

"Palmetto City CTW" (https://github.com/PGMNetwork/Maps/tree/master/Palmetto%20City%20CTW), 

"Shoppal Jixreleu" (https://github.com/PGMNetwork/Maps/tree/master/Shoppal%20Jixreleu), 

and Labritorium. (https://github.com/PGMNetwork/Maps/tree/master/Labritorium) 

Many other maps have been stolen, but by other authors.

__What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository's URL:__

https://github.com/PGMNetwork/Maps. 

(Individual Files:

__Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?__

This work is private and is unlicensed. I have allowed it to be used by Stratus Network and Aperture Scrim Servers, but no others as of the time of submitting this DCMA.

__What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?__

The best solution would be to remove the entire repository. Many of the maps are stolen from various authors, and I presume you'll be getting other DCMA's at some point from them. If that isn't possible, removing just the maps made and owned by myself would suffice.

__Do you have the alleged infringer's contact information? If so, please provide it:__

I do not have the contact information of the infringer.

"I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration."

"I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed."
