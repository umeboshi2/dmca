Requesting removal confidential copyrighted source code published at   
https://github.com/mafiozi/hitask-webapp   

I have read and understand GitHubâ€™s Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.  

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.  

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.  

We hired [private], https://github.com/mafiozi, https://github.com/must-be-perfect, month ago through [private] and gave access to our privately-hosted repository.
Developer agreed to signed NDA. However after concluding work with us he for some reason published our project Confidential source code https://github.com/mafiozi/hitask-webapp  

Developer signed the NDA that covers the source code and thus by publishing this code violated this NDA which is a criminal offence.  

Please help us and remove this source code from public repository https://github.com/mafiozi/hitask-webapp  
Due to this person unlawful acts performed on github you may also want to ban or disable this person's github account.

Thank you.
