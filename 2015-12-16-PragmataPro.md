DMCA Take Down Notice

My name is [private] and I’m the copyright owner of
PragmataPro™ registered at US Copyright Office with this code VA 1-905-952
I have read and understand GitHub’s Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

You can understand that I’m the author and copyright owner of the work if you go to
http://www.fsd.it/shop/fonts/pragmatapro

The GitHub user “xpando” (https://github.com/xpando) publish the font family named “PragmataPro”
in its repository named “Dash” in the directory “Fonts”:  
https://github.com/xpando/Dash/blob/master/Fonts/PragmataPro.ttf
https://github.com/xpando/Dash/blob/master/Fonts/PragmataPro-B.ttf
https://github.com/xpando/Dash/blob/master/Fonts/PragmataPro-I.ttf
https://github.com/xpando/Dash/blob/master/Fonts/PragmataPro-Z.ttf

That user never asked me to distribute these fonts, I tried many times to contacted directly but
without success.

I proposed a repository modified without my font files but he ignored also this attempt.

I remember that Italian law of 22.04.1941 n° 633 and European directive 2001/29/CE don’t allows
to resell or distribute copyrighted works without my permition and the user don’t has it

Please remove these font files because this file are reach the top in Google results page asking
about “PragmataPro” and this is inaceptable to me. I live also thanks to my font sales.

I hope you can understand me.

Thank you!
