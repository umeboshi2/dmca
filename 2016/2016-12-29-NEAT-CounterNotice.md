The allegation of infringement by [private] (github ID: rwesson, email: [private]) is false and incorrect. The material in question written in IDL and Python, wheres he wrote his code in FORTRAN. The material in question is not the same, moreover is not copyrighted. It is therefore in the public domain and may be reproduced by anyone. I took them from  
https://trac.stsci.edu/ssb/stsci_python/browser/stsdas/trunk/stsdas/lib/synphot/ebmvlfunc.x

https://github.com/equib/MOCASSIN-2.0/tree/master/data  

They are not from   
https://github.com/rwesson/NEAT  
NEAT used many public codes (EQUIB, STSDAS deredden functions and X-W. Liu's MIDAS ORL scripts, UCL atomic data). Roger Wesson is not the copyright owner of them.

Furthermore, the complainant has provided no proof that I used his code copyright registration information or other tangible evidence that the material in question is in fact copyrighted, and I have a good faith belief that it is not. The allegation of copyright violation is therefore in dispute, and at present unsupported.

My code has be registered here:  
http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ascl.soft11022D
http://ascl.net/1611.022  
His allegation of infringement is false.
