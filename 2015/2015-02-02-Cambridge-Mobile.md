Dear GitHub Copyright Agent,

Recently, I sent you a request to remove proprietary and copyrighted material belonging to Cambridge Mobile, Ltd. (â€œCambridgeâ€). I have found additional copies of the same material and request that it also be taken down. There has not been any response from SVOX AG which has falsely attributed my source code to themselves. SVOX AG has included their address in the file: Baslerstr. 30, 8048 Zuerich, Switzerland.

Federal law requires expeditious removal of the infringing material or liability accrues for the failure to remove the material. I renew my request that the proprietary and copyrighted material belonging to Cambridge be removed.

I, the undersigned, state UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY that:

[1] I am a person injured, or an agent authorized to act on behalf of a person injured by a violation of the U.S. Copyright laws, in particular section 501 of Title 17 of the United States Code, commonly referred to as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, or "DMCA";

[2] I May Be Contacted At:

Name of Injured Party : Cambridge Mobile, Ltd.

Name and Title: [private]

Company: Cambridge Mobile, Ltd.

Address: [private]

Email address: sales@cambridgemobile.com

Telephone: [private]

[3] I have a good faith belief that the user-posted repositories identified by the URLs below are unlawful because, among other issues, the content constitutes unauthorized copying and distribution of portions of Cambridge's World Bench, constitutes confidential information, and a violation of the copyright. Although the file, com_svox_picottsengine.cpp , bears an attribution to SVOX AG in 2008-2009, it contains copyrighted source code written years earlier by me and assigned to Cambridge. I am the author of the claimed work and no portion of this work was assigned or licensed to SVOX AG. Accordingly, the content infringes Cambridgeâ€™s rights under the federal copyright laws, including the DMCA and Copyright Act. I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

[4] Reason:

Content Type: World Bench

Violation(s): Copyright Infringement

[5] Please act expeditiously to remove the content found at the following repositories and related forks:
