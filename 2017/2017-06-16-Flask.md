**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository's URL:**

The repository contains a complete, original copy of the e-book in PDF format, plus a Chinese translation of some of the chapters. Below is the repository URL, plus all its forks:

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes, all the URLs are included above.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No. The work is under copyright and not licensed under an open source license.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**

The PDF for the book, and the translated chapters must be removed. Since the entirety of the repository contains book material, I consider the complete repository and their forks need to be removed.

**Do you have the alleged infringer's contact information? If so, please provide it:**

No.
