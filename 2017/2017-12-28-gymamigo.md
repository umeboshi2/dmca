I can confirm I am the copyright owner of the site gymamigo.com, which has been copied exactly onto a site hosted by github at gymamigo.me.  
The whole site, including homepage and internal pages (including legal and policy pages) has been directly copied. The website is copyrighted to GYM AMIGO, and has been wholly copied with the intention of impersonating our brand as a fishing website.   The whole site must be taken down. The site is using WhoIsGuard to cover up infringers details, our legal team sent a cieae and desist letter to the corresponding WhoIsGuard email address, however a reply wasnâ€™t received as off 22/12/2017.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.  
I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
