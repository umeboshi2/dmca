**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**  

Yes. I am a member of GenisysPro organization and a contributor of [GenisysPro/GenisysPro](https://github.com/GenisysPro/GenisysPro) project ("our project"), and I hereby represent the GenisysPro organizaion.  

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**  

Our project is licensed under [GNU General Public License (GPL) version 3.0](https://github.com/GenisysPro/GenisysPro/blob/master/LICENSE) ("the License"). Many people who use code from our project obeyed terms in the License, but there are some people who ignored and violated some terms in the License.

[iYihuan/GenisysPlus](https://github.com/iYihuan/GenisysPlus) used code of our project, although not explicitly stated. This did not violate the License, and it is not the point I am reporting. An indicator showing GenisysPlus copies code from our project is at [here](https://github.com/GenisysPro/GenisysPro/blob/master/src/pocketmine/Server.php#L1972) and [here](https://github.com/iYihuan/GenisysPlus/blob/master/src/pocketmine/Server.php#L1970). That block of code was added recently by our organization, an GenisysPlus copied the code. Another one, which is very obvious, is at [here](https://github.com/iYihuan/GenisysPlus/blob/master/src/pocketmine/resourcepacks/ResourcePack.php). They preserved our header in that file, so the code in the file should be taken from our project.  

We believe that by copying our code, which is licensed under the License, GenisysPlus
became a work "based on" our project, hence GenisysPlus should be defined as a "covered work" described in section 0 of the License, and needs to be distributed under the terms of the License.  

Section 4 in the License requires providing a copy of the License to all receivers of verbatim copies of source code of our project. Section 5 in the License requires that people who distribute source code of a work based on our project "under the terms of section 4". Item b) in section 5 only overwrites requirements on "keep intact all notices" in section 4, which is nothing about providing a copy of the License.  

GenisysPlus only included a copyright notice [at the end of their README](https://github.com/iYihuan/GenisysPlus#licence) that their program is licensed under GNU General Public License version 3.0. There is no copy of the License in the repository. This is a violation of the term in sections 4 and 5 in the License.  

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository's URL:**  

[iYihuan/GenisysPlus](https://github.com/iYihuan/GenisysPlus)  

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  

There was no fork of the repository at the time when this notice was being sent.  

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**  

GenisysPlus only included a copyright notice [at the end of their README](https://github.com/iYihuan/GenisysPlus#licence) that their program is licensed under GNU General Public License version 3.0. There is no copy of the License in the repository. This is a violation of the term in sections 4 and 5 in the License.  

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**  

We hope that contributors of GenisysPlus can respect our work and terms in the License and add appropriate copyright notices to their project, including a copy of the License.  

**Do you have the alleged infringer's contact information? If so, please provide it:**  

We do not have their contact information.  

**Type (or copy and paste) the following statement: "I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration."**
