I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

My jadb project (found here <https://github.com/vidstige/jadb>) was cloned (
here <https://github.com/etexier/jadb>), and then the copyright notice was
removed although the accompanying copyright text states clearly it is not
something you can do. Basically he's taken my work and put it on github as
his own. This is clearly against the clear copyright found here
<https://github.com/vidstige/jadb/blob/master/LICENSE.md> under section 4.

To remedy this infringement he needs to re-add the copyright notice, and
also re-add me as the author, or take down the project.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described
above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner,
or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this
notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am
authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is
allegedly infringed.
