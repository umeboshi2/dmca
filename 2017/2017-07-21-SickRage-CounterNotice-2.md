We've received a takedown notice for https://github.com/pymedusa/Medusa.

**Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?**  

We'd like to make changes to the content, but not as requested by the DMCA instigator.
As he is claiming to be the copyright owner, while he is not.  
Therefor we dispute the notice as send to us.  
But we do not want to violate the original license as owned by [private] (https://github.com/midgetspy).  
And therefor have decided to restore the copyright notice to its original author [private] (https://github.com/midgetspy).  
The original author [private] has also been made aware of the DMCA here: https://github.com/SickRage/SickRage/pull/3938.  

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake? (optional)**  

Additionally, by issuing the take-down notice, the author of this claim is wrongfully impersonating himself as the original author of the mentioned source code, as visible in this commit:    https://github.com/SiCKRAGETV/SiCKRAGE/commit/99fb37277daf8bce54273b3128347117081745b7#diff-21c55fa400e4d25aed3a755371e32151.  
We would like to stress out that the source code is solely licensed by [private] under GPL v3.0, originally released within the project "Sick-Beard" (https://github.com/midgetspy/Sick-Beard).  

We hope to have addressed all issues and shed some light about this situation.  
If you have any other questions or concerns about the matter, don't hesitate to contact us.
