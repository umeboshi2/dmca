	Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?  
  
Yes, I'm Synology Surveillance [private] and authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.On behalf of Synology, I ask for removing the infringed code.  
  
	Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.  
  
The purpose of “surveillance.txt” may produce the Surveillance Device Licenses of Synology which is NOT for free to use. Each license must be bought from Synology or it‘s agents, otherwise, it is illegal and infringed. From the EULA (https://www.synology.com/en-us/company/legal/terms_EULA), any Synology License which is not officially provided by Synology is illegal. Therefore, we strongly demanded that Github should remove the code.  
  
PS: Synology Surveillance Device License Packs are designed for expanding camera, I/O module, and access controllers set up on Synology Surveillance Station. The detail is here (https://www.synology.com/en-global/products/Device_License_Pack).
