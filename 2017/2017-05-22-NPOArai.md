This guy, called [private], was hired to develop this website with our team and promised to keep it as confidential, even prohibited to tell that he's been working with us for this client.  
Later, he broke the agreement and public this on GitHub which is probibited to public anywhere else.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository's URL:**  
http://baonguyenyam.github.io/demo/NPO_arai/  
all should be put down in this "NPO Arai" folder.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  
We searched and found this on Google accidentally.  
We cannot contact him to put it down, it seems like he did it on purpose, he even publish this on his service provider website http://viensoi.com/vi/du-an/vien-duong-lao-nhat-npo-aria, which is completely against the agreement here
Therefore, I have no way other than to submit this DMCA.  

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**  
This is handcoded html website.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**  
As he hasnot responded to us recently for 2 days, I requested to remove completely all files at NPR Arai folder.
