To Github,

I found that there are some repo, the code is completely consistent with my code, I am the copyright owner of the source code , but they are infringing: 

+ https://github.com/wjj7989/suning-ios
+ https://github.com/f22x/e-buy
+ https://github.com/yalay/suning
+ https://github.com/dangxiaobo/suning-1

I would like to remove and disable the above repositories due to infringement of our codebase. I have since reviewed and investigated a substantial amount of forked repos (example listed below). All the forked repos are infringing to the same extent as the parent repository. I would like to remove and disable all the forked repositories as well.

Example of reviewed forked repos:
