To whom it may concern,

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

This DMCA takedown is for the following projects hosted on your website:

* https://github.com/Softpampa/barcode  
* [file already removed by user]  
* https://github.com/jaschweder/dinesh-barcode  
* [file already removed by user]  
* https://github.com/shangguokan/SGKBarcodeBundle  
* [file already removed by user]  
* https://github.com/rseyferth/barcode

* https://github.com/yasasn86/SGKBarcodeBundle  
* https://github.com/printedcom/barcode  
* https://github.com/oborerichard/barcode  

I have investigated each individual case and I have noticed that the
projects listed above are using source code copied from the project
https://github.com/tecnickcom/TCPDF
originally hosted at http://sourceforge.net/projects/tcpdf/ but all
original notices about author, copyright and license were removed or
replaced.

All the projects appears to have cloned their code from a project that
was already taken down in August 2015
(https://github.com/dineshrabara/barcodeAll).

The first commit on the copied PARENT project was indicated as 5 June
2014, so it can be safely compared against TCPDF version 6.0.083
released 29 May 2014 (https://github.com/tecnickcom/TCPDF/tree/6.0.083):

The following files appears to be almost verbatim copies of the original
ones, with the exception of the legal notices removed (author, copyright
and license):

* Datamatrix.php (include/barcodes/datamatrix.php)  
* DNS1D.php (tcpdf_barcodes_1d.php)  
* DNS2D.php (tcpdf_barcodes_2d.php)  
* PDF417.php (include/barcodes/pdf417.php)  
* QRcode.php (include/barcodes/qrcode.php)  

The original code is released under the GNU LGPLv3 license and
copyrighted by [private] - Tecnick.com LTD, but none of this
information is present in the copied files.  
https://github.com/tecnickcom/TCPDF/blob/6.0.083/LICENSE.TXT

The options to remedy the infringement are:

1. delete the project - this seems the best option as this project is
not adding anything to the original files.
2. if the license is compatible with GNU-LGPLv3, replace the infringing
files with the original ones, or reinstate the original notices (author,
copyright, license);
3. delete the infringing files and use the new external library
https://github.com/tecnickcom/tc-lib-barcode (originally based on the
same TCPDF code but with tons of bug fixes and improvements).

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials
described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the
copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.
I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this
notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am
authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is
allegedly infringed.

The only contact information I have about the infringers is the one
derived from their GitHub page (please see the preceding links above).

Please send me a prompt response indicating the actions you have taken
to resolve this matter as soon as possible.
