**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**    
Yes, I am the copyright owner.  

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**    
Original work: https://github.com/appu1232/Discord-Selfbot    
Copied work: https://github.com/Incarceron/DiscordSelfBot    
As well as the commit where he removes the MIT copyright from the files on Github... :   https://github.com/Incarceron/DiscordSelfBot/commit/9ad2696d6e42c6f6810a8f0d647c1bbdf46b86b2  
As shown, he basically created the same project and kept virtually everything the same (as of that day when he copied it, my original work has since been updated more since then) except he has removed all credit towards me as the original creator.  

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository's URL:**  
Entire repository: https://github.com/Incarceron/DiscordSelfBot

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  
There doesn't seem to be any forks of this work.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**  
My work is under the MIT license: https://github.com/appu1232/Discord-Selfbot/blob/master/LICENSE.txt
And the copied work seems to be the GNU General Public License: https://github.com/Incarceron/DiscordSelfBot/blob/master/LICENSE

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**  
I believe the best solution here would be to just delete this repository. If possible they could add my name and clearly say that this isn't their work but seeing as they went as far as deleting the original license and my name from the work, I don't think this is going to happen and therefore the repo should just be deleted.

**Do you have the alleged infringer's contact information? If so, please provide it:**  
No contact information besides their Github account: https://github.com/Incarceron
