**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**  
I am the copyright owner of the programming assets.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**  
I created an Undertale fan-game with the middleware program Construct 2. An authorized copy can be found here:
http://jcw87.github.io/c2-sans-fight/

The unauthorized copy is here:
https://zltttt.github.io/Bad_Time_Simulator_(Sans_Fight)/

Due to the nature of fan-games, I feel the need to make it explicitly clear that this claim is on the programming assets only, not the image assets, nor the sound assets.
