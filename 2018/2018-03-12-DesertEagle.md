Besides those two the person in question also has more Repositories that infringes rights from other people. I tried to talk to him and ask to remove the repositories but he says that everyone else is doing what he does so why shouldn't I.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository's URL:**  
https://github.com/Paiva001/Remove-Desert-Eagle    
https://github.com/Paiva001/HUD-Mensages/  
https://github.com/Paiva001/Roulette/

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  
Yes

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**  
The work is under The Unlicense license, however as stated in the original work License both works should share the same License. Also they should state changes however there aren't even any significant changes. It's just a copy paste of my work

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**  
The user is not using the same license and is not including the original work. With that I ask that they state somewhere in their repo where the original can be found and that they change the license

I only have his Steam Account [private]
