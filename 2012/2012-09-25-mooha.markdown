Hello GitHub,

My project Mooha (SyncML server written in PHP) was published in your repository by unauthorized users.
I would like it to be removed.
My copyright with validated email (private]) is
included to almost every file of the project.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials
described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the
copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this
notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am
authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that
is allegedly infringed.

Thank you
