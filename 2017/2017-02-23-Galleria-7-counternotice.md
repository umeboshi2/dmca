**Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?**  
dispute the notice

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake? (optional)**  
Disputed material seems to be under MIT licence, as stated at the top of the Javascript file. Lots of other disputed repositories in your DMCA letter seem to also have this MIT licence mention in their files, so I don't think they added falsey licence information.
I am not the developer who imported this Galleria theme into our code, but the culture of my employer Imagination For People (NGO) and this initial analysis makes me guess that we did not disrespect any licence for this material. I think this material was under MIT licence when we found it on its official website and used it, and then Galleria provider changed owner and probably tried to change their pricing/licencing. So I would say that we still respect law and licence.
