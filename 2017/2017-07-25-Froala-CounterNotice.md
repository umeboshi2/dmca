This is a product I have written completely. It does not contain other people's code. All the code is open and you can look at the commits, what and when I wrote.

The owner of froala at least speaks about the old version of the program, which is here http://xdsoft.net/jodit/ and here https://github.com/xdan/jodit2  
At the same time it is said that he had a design and code, but that's not true. I can also open the source code for this repository. In this design is almost in all WYSIWYG editors.
