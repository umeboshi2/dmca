**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**  
This project on GitHub is illegally and freely distributing four of my fonts: Vaud Display Bold, Vaud Display Light, Vaud Display Medium and Vaud Display Book. These fonts/typefaces are of my design and are software owned wholly by me. They are commercially licensable typefaces and the user [private] (user name: alubling) is distributing them illegally.  

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL:**  

https://github.com/alubling/Relate/tree/master/vendor/fonts

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  

There are no forks.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**  

These font files are sold with a proprietary end user license agreement. They are *not* open source and they are not allowed to be altered or distributed.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**  

The font files should be removed from GitHub.
