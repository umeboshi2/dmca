Dear Sir, Madam,

Please find our copyright infringement which follow your DMCA procedure:

**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**  
Yes

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**  
The video game DOFUS TOUCH: www.dofus-touch.com. DOFUS TOUCH is a Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG) created by our company Ankama. You can find more details about this game on our website, in particular on this page:   http://www.dofus-touch.com/en/mmorpg/discover.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository's URL:**  
https://github.com/SwiTool/Dofucks/  
https://github.com/asuralove/Dofucks  
https://github.com/ricoxor/Dofucks  

These repositories contain unauthorized copy of code from DOFUS TOUCH video game. These repositories also contain the code of an automation software (a "bot") intended to be used in our video game.

A bot is a computer program that performs automated tasks in the game, such as attacking enemies or harvesting raw materials. Once the program has been configured to perform a specific action, human intervention is no longer necessary: the game character is controlled by the software.

To create such software, it is necessary to bypass technological protection measures that protect our video game, which are intended to prevent, or at least limit, unauthorized use of this game. The creation of such software also requires the decompilation, the translation and then the reproduction of our game client.

The use of bot is strictly prohibited by our rules and poses a serious threat to the game's economy.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  
Yes

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**
