One engineer who is working for our company with github account [private] posted 4 software in github without declare a license. In fact, these software's copyright belongs to our company and [private] does not have the right to share the code online. I have asked him to remove the code from github and he did it. But I have found that the other user with account "wpmyj" has forked the 4 repositories.  

So I here I am asking help to take down the 4 repositories from github.  

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository's URL:**

https://github.com/wpmyj/Server  
https://github.com/wpmyj/Maintenance  

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  
Yes, I have searched.  

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**  
No license are declared.  

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**  
Removal from github is the best solution.
