I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**  
Yes, I am the copyright owner.

**What work was allegedly infringed? If possible, please provide a URL:**  
I am a professor at Georgia Tech. I teach an online course to nearly 500 students each semester. As part of this course my TAs and I share a repo with the students that provides them with template code that they use to complete their assignments. Unfortunately some students place this code in public repos, even though they have been told not to. We have contacted the folks who still have this code in public repos -- multiple times. Some of them have responded, and taken the code down. Some have not. The ones who have not are the subject of this request.

Here is the list of repos that I request to be taken down:

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  
Yes I have searched for forks, there are two infringing forks listed above.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**  
The work is not licensed. All rights are reserved.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**  
I request that the infringers either remove the repos or make them private.

**Do you have the alleged infringer's contact information? If so, please provide it:**
