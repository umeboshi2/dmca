To Whom It May Concern:

​My name is [private] from Tenable Network Security, Inc. ("Tenable")
and on behalf of Tenable, I am sending a take down notice to your website
of Tenable's copyright material. It has come to Tenable's attention that
GitHub's website contains Tenable owned copyright material and this letter
serves an official take down notification under the provisions of the
Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) to have the infringing content
removed immediately from your website:  

https://github.com/und3rdog/Red/tree/master/all-2.0  
​These plugins clearly list Tenable as the copyright owner.  
Furthermore,
I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

​I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described
above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner,
or its agent, or the law, and hereby confirm that the information in this
notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that I am
authorized to act on behalf of Tenable, the owner of the exclusive right
that is allegedly infringed.​

​Your prompt response indicating you have taken actions to resolve this
matter is greatly appreciated. Many thanks.

​

All the best,

[private]
