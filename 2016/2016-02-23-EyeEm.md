hello there, I'm writing to request the immediate takedown of the following
repository:

*https://github.com/julem/GitHub <https://github.com/julem/GitHub>*

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

The entire repository consists of work done by the user while in our
employment, it also contains cleartext access codes and parameters that
were never authorized to be made public. I have contacted the user "julem" [Private] (who is no longer employed here) to delete the
repository, and having not yet received a response, would like to expedite
this as the scripts expose a lot of private information.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described
above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner,
or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this
notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am
authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is
allegedly infringed.

thank you
