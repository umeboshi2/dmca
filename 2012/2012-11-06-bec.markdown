My name is [private].  
I am the developer of a tool called Bec for arma2 servers.

I previously contacted github on the support-email regarding a user who is distobuting my application on github. But I was refered to a dmca takedown page..

The user Rinaun on github is violating the license of Bec.

He is distributing Bec. as show in the link below.

https://github.com/Rinaun/BEC/tree/master/BEC  
https://github.com/Rinaun

This is agains the license of Bec.

I came across this  
http://dayzmod.com/forum/index.php?/topic/104014-how-to-optimize-performance-lockchange-time-moon-and-other-mods/#entry980298  
And already tried to contact him on that forum, without luck.

My homepage that is hosting Bec can be found here.

If you want/need to view the full license go to the downloade page and press download. it will popup.. its also included as a txt file in the zip packet you download if you agree to the terms.

I request that you remove the option to download bec.exe form github.
