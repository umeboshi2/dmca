I am the [Private] copyright owner of the game "Barotrauma". An user with the username "Barotrauma" has apparently decompiled the game executable into source code and released it on GitHub.

Link to the official website of the game: http://undertowgames.com/barotrauma/

Link to the infringing GitHub repository: https://github.com/Barotrauma/Barotrauma

Link to the GitHub profile of the infringer: https://github.com/Barotrauma

The game is not under an open source license, nor is the source code publicly available. The user has no permission to publish the source code or distribute copies of the game. I request the entire repository (https://github.com/Barotrauma/Barotrauma) to be taken down.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

I confirm that I have read your Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice: https://help.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/ and I have followed the instructions in the guide to the best of my ability.

Thank you,

[Private]
