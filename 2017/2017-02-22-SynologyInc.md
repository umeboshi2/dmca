**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Ans:
Yes, I'm Syology Surveillance PM and authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.
On behalf of Synology, I ask for removing the infringed code.

**What work was allegedly infringed? If possible, please provide a URL:**

Ans:
The purpose of synogen.cpp may produce the Surveillance Device Licenses of Synology which is NOT for free to use. Each license must be bought from Synology or it‘s agents, otherwise, it is illegal and infringed. From the EULA (https://www.synology.com/en-us/company/legal/terms_EULA), any Synology License which is not officially provided by Synology is illegal. Therefore, we strongly demanded that Github should remove the code.

PS: Synology Surveillance Device License Packs are designed for expanding camera, I/O module, and access controllers set up on Synology Surveillance Station. The detail is here (https://www.synology.com/en-global/products/Device_License_Pack).

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository's URL:**

Ans:
https://github.com/gabonator/Work-in-progress/blob/master/SynologySearchEngine/ApiExperiments/synogen.cpp

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Ans:
Yes, I have checked. There is only one URL I provided above needs to be deleted.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

Ans:
No, it is not open source license. Synology will never provide any License generator.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**

Ans:
Please remove it. There is no other solution because it is illegal.

**Do you have the alleged infringer's contact information? If so, please provide it:**

Ans:
No. I don’t have alleged infringer's contact information. I only know the information provided form Github.

**Type (or copy and paste) the following statement: "I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration."**
