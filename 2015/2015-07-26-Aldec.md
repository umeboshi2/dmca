Dear GitHub Copyright Agent:
[1] I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

[2] Infringed content: Decryptor files

[3] I have a good faith belief that the file-downloads identified below (by
URL) are unlawful under these laws because, among other things, the files
circumvent effective access controls and/or copyright protection measures;
Violation(s): Downloaded file contains corporate private encryption key
obtained as a result of infringement.

[4] Please act expeditiously to remove the file-downloads found at the
following URL:  
https://github.com/dmitrodem/p1735_decryptor

[private]

[6] Not known.

[7] I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials
described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the
copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

[8] I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this
notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized
to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly
infringed.

Thank you for your kind assistance.

Truthfully,
