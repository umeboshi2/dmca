Dear Sir or Madam:

Our firm represents Virtu Financial LLC and Virtu Americas LLC (collectively, "Virtu") in intellectual property matters, including matters involving the infringement of its intellectual property rights. It recently came to Virtu's attention that copyright-protected works owned by Virtu, including but not limited to documents, software code, and source files (the "Protected Works"), were posted on GitHub without Virtu's permission by the user, "[private]." One of these Protected Works was copied by another user, "VinACE." This posting by VinACE was also made without Virtu's permission and infringes on Virtu's copyrights in the Protected Works. The documents, code, and files appear in this repository at https://github.com/VinACE/TableHunter-For-Oracle.

On behalf of Virtu, we hereby demand the immediate removal of the aforementioned infringing materials, including the repositories and all documents, code, and files within the repositories at the above-identified URLs, from your servers in accordance with Section 512(c) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA").

This e-mail is official notification under Section 512(c) of the DMCA. Please be advised that the law requires you to remove or disable access to the infringing materials upon receiving this notice.

We are providing this notice under a good faith belief that the use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agents, or the law. The information in this notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, we state that we are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.

We demand that you respond to this correspondence immediately and provide written assurances that you have removed all documents, code, and files at the above-identified URLs and/or disabled access to them and will take all necessary steps to preserve Virtu's intellectual property rights.
