I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

We have identified a source code file within an account of an ex-employee of our organization, Asurion LLC.

The file can be found at: https://github.com/sreeramanathan/onejar-jersey/tree/master/src/main/java/com/asurion/sample/launch.

When accessing this link, the information shared clearly shows that the file is Asurion-specific in both the file tree and the code itself as shown below.

We are requesting the file be removed from the site and completely purged from the user's account. This is proprietary company information that is in direct violation of Asurion corporate policy. From the initial request last week, attached, we have received no response.

The only contact information we could garner for the user is [private].

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Please let me know if there is any further information or action required on our end.

Thanks,
