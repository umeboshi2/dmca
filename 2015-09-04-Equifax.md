To whom it may concern:

Further to my previous request emailed on Friday, September 4, 2015, please see the revised request below, which includes additional information regarding the original work that has been infringed.

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

The projects at https://github.com/l3onL/kbl and https://github.com/l3onL/ctl were uploaded without permission from Equifax and contain the intellectual property of Equifax. The intellectual property includes, but is not limited to, code copied from an internal project containing proprietary and confidential logic. Additional information regarding the original work can be obtained by contacting the undersigned attorney.

We demand that the entire content of these projects be removed.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Thank you for your assistance with this matter.
