They don't show up as forks on GitHub because they've been rehosted (i.e. created and then pushed).

__Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.__

Yes.

__Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?__

Yes, under the Apache License 2.0.

They violate the following terms of the license:
- removal of the copyright notice
- failure to reference original code and author
- failure to state changes
- claiming copyright and authorship over the entire body of work

__What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?__

In good faith, I'd rather the infringing repositories are not removed, although I've contacted the owner of the repositories numerous times regarding this matter and have received no response. In any case, to avoid removal of the infringing repositories the owner can update the projects to mention that they are based on the originating code, state the changes and restore the copyright notice.

__Do you have the alleged infringer's contact information? If so, please provide it:__
