Hey guys.

I'd like to submit an another DMCA notice.

*I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.*

*Identify the copyrighted work you believe has been infringed:*

I'm author of the Anti-Cheat Toolkit Unity plugin which I sell exclusively
at the Unity Asset Store:

*https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/10395  
<https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/10395>*

I sell it with full source code.

But that source code shouldn't be published anywhere, as it violates Asset
Store Terms of Service and EULA (http://unity3d.com/ru/legal/as_terms),
APPENDIX 1, sections 5 & 9 and my own copyrights.

*Identify the material that you allege is infringing the copyrighted work
listed in item #2, above.*

I found my plugin's sources with public access here:

*https://github.com/l980305284/UnityProject/tree/master/Anti-Cheat/Assets/AntiCheatToolkit  
<https://github.com/l980305284/UnityProject/tree/master/Anti-Cheat/Assets/AntiCheatToolkit>*

I made issue about this infringement:

*https://github.com/l980305284/UnityProject/issues/1  
<https://github.com/l980305284/UnityProject/issues/1>*
But got no response within 3 days.

*Explain what the affected user would need to do in order to remedy the
infringement.*

I'm afraid the only way to remedy it is to remove whole repository from
GitHub or convert it to the private one if possible since Maintainer can be
accessed from older commits.

*Provide your contact information.*

[Private]

*Provide contact information, if you know it, for the alleged infringer.*

I believe repository author is alleged infringer in this case:
https://github.com/l980305284 

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described
above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner,
or its agent, or the law.
I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this
notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am	
authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is
allegedly infringed.

*Include your physical or electronic signature.*

Best Regards, [Private]
