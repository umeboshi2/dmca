**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes

**What work was allegedly infringed? If possible, please provide a URL:**

A macOS file enforcement application. http://www.littleflocker.com

The project was intended to be publicly available when it was a prior and differently named project under development, eg different project. We did a mass rename, changed the project name and got it ready for a binary (and private source) release under the name Little Flocker. During that time, we didn't intend the code to be public and took it down once realizing we were still committing to the old public repo instead of committing to the private repo we had set up on gitlab like I'd thought. During that time it was apparently cloned. The old readme and other content was simply changed in the rename, and although we had considered open sourcing it under the new project, we ultimately did not. It was never intended for "Little Flocker" to be available publicly. Only the packages. As I also mentioned, even the license in the readme isn't authorizing reuse, nor is license given to redistribute the code either in the form of clone or other. But this is only secondary to the fact that we intended the project to be pulled down when it was renamed, in spite of past efforts for public review of the older code.

These accounts appear to be dead; we've attempted to contact them but no response. We simply want to remove the code that's been posted since the name change as this has never been intentional. This is also dangerous code for anyone to be running as it's prerelease and buggy; people seem to be confusing it with the released project, causing possible vulnerabilities.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository's URL:**  

https://github.com/0xe1a00000/littleflocker  
https://github.com/jaouahbi/littleflocker

And any other clones we haven't been able to identify.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No files are licensed under an open source license. Neither the source or the binaries in the repo are licensed for redistribution.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**

Complete removal of the repositories and any clones.

**Do you have the alleged infringer's contact information? If so, please provide it:**

No
