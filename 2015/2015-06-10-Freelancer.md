Hi Github Copyright Department,

Somebody has put my website code publicity available to all.

https://github.com/deepaktiwari1987/Freelancer

I want this code to be removed from his account as soon as possible.

*I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.*

*I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described
above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner,
or its agent, or the law.*

*I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this
notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am
authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is
allegedly infringed.*

Kind regards,
