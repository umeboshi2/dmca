To whom it may concern,

My name is [private] and I am writing you this e-mail to
submit a DMCA Takedown Notice. A prototype software license, which I
created 2 years ago, was submitted to the OSI mailing list to be
reviewed for approval. A GitHub user(rootls) uploaded the license on his
repository, without my contest.

The submission mailing list post can be found at:

https://lists.opensource.org/pipermail/license-review/2014-March/002084.html

The unauthorized file can be found at:

https://github.com/rootls/aksharlicense/blob/master/PSL-1.0.txt

As mentioned above, the license has not been accepted from the OSI and
the Free Software Foundation for use at a software program. At that time
the license was at a prototype phase and until now it has been abandoned.

As such, the reported user would only have to remove the license from
the repository.

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials
described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the
copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this
notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am
authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is
allegedly infringed.*

Should you wish to discuss this with me contact me directly.
