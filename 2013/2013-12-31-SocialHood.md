This is a copy of the source code of https://socialhood.com maintained at https://github.com/socialhood/ - private copyrighted data that an outside contractor copied and did not keep private. The contractor has not responded to our request to remove the repo or modify the repo to be private. This is a major security concern for our company because details about our site's source code have been leaked to the internet.
