I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

I am the owner of the Unity plugin uLua which is a package of Lua and
LuaInterface with a proprietary wrapper code and build scripts to enable it
to function on all Unity target platforms.

uLua Unity Asset Store (my work)

sLua (infringing work)

https://github.com/pangweiwei/slua

My source code was uploaded to Github as a basis for sLua (the infringing
material). All subsequent work on sLua is therefore a derivative of my
initial work, which was not free to be copied and re-used.

An example of the blatant theft of my work is here in an early commit of
sLua:

https://github.com/pangweiwei/slua/commit/1c959a4f6d160ad401c9be0733bccdffdf8078b8

This includes my copyright notice and name fully in the file on his
repository.

Since all later work on this repository is based on my initial stolen work,
I'd like the entire repository removed as a derivative of copyright
material. I have attempted to communicate with the owner of this repository
and have only received hostility about their right to steal my work.
