In short, the original repository are required to be under GPL-2.0 (which we implicit acknowledge that). In the original DMCA, he said that "This work not licensed under Open Source License.", while his work HAVE TO be licensed and acknowledged to be licensed under GPL-2.0.

In long:

1. Proof
+ In Custom Weather by axiieflex/Program.cs, lines 4 & 5 "using Ensage.Common;using Ensage.Common.Menu;".
+ Ensage.Common is a Library under GPL-2.0, https://github.com/EnsageSharp/Ensage.Common

2. He acknowledge that his work is going to be under GNU licences: The projects in my repository and in his repository had been released under Joduska.me (For EnsageSharp and LeagueSharp). EnsageSharp is developed after LeagueSharp, but the structure of 2 projects are the same).
In Joduska.me forum, the global forum rules (https://www.joduska.me/forum/forum-6/announcement-1-global-forum-rules/) said that "LeagueSharp assemblies that use the Library "LeagueSharp.Common" are protected by the GNU license and have to be released open-source.".
I understand EnsageSharp.Common is a different product, but the principle is the same: "Ensage.Common" is protected under GPL-2.0, so all the assemblies that use Ensage.Common have to be released open-source
