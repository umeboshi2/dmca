I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**What work was allegedly infringed? If possible, please provide a URL:**  
http://azer-cms.com/?page=downloads&file=Azer_CMS_V3.0

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository's URL:**
https://github.com/mynew5/ApocalypseCoreWeb    
https://github.com/concept45/ApocalypseCoreWeb    
https://github.com/Refuge89/ApocalypseCoreWeb    
https://github.com/erwieder/ApocalypseCoreWeb

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  
These are forks of an original repo that was the subject of a previous DMCA Takedown sent to GitHub, Inc. that were unable to be found in the initial investigation. Once we were alerted of these forks, the 'master' fork that all of the other forks stem from was investigated and found to be no different than the original repo from the previous takedown. (the forks stemming from this 'master' fork are 'even' with it)

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**  
The work is not licensed under an open-source license. See "Use License" under our Terms of Service, located at http://azer-cms.com/?page=topic&id=10&t=10

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**  
Repository removal is the only solution, being that it is no different than the original repository from the initial takedown.

**Do you have the alleged infringer's contact information? If so, please provide it:**   
Unfortunately, we do not. The .TK Domain Name listed under the repositories does not lead to their website.
