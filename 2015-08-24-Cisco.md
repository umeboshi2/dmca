Dear GitHub,

I would like to kindly request that you take down the following code repository:

https://github.com/zerix/Cavium-SDK-2.0

The above code repository contains code that was Authored by Me ("[Private] authored on Mar 8, 2011”) and copyrighted by Cisco Systems Inc and is for Cisco Employee Eyes only. The project was developed at Cisco Systems Inc, San Jose, and is provided to Cisco Employees with a license agreement that allows only private/individual copies of the code (Cisco explicitly disallows placing the code somewhere publicly accessible). As such, the posting of this code to your site is a copyright violation.

This proprietary code repository was accidentally uploaded by another Cisco employee to Github and has been forked by the new owner “zerix"

I have sent several emails to the repository owner directly with this request, but have not gotten any response.

1. I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

2. The copyrighted work is listed in the above repository.

3. All of the material in the repository above are under this license agreement.

4. All of the material must be deleted or set to private visibility.

5. You may contact me at:
