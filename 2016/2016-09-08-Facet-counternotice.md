This is a counter notification pursuant to 17 U.S.C. 512(g)(3). I have read
and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Counter Notice.

The content that was disabled is the repository located at the following
link: https://github.com/implydata/imply-pivot.

My contact information is as follows:

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the
material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or
misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.

Specifically, as Metamarkets recognizes, the imply-pivot repository does
not incldue and has never included the only material alleged to have been
copied in Metamarkets' previous DMCA notice, which was one comment in the
code. Far from being a repeat infringer, Imply Data has acted to remove
from its source code history the material identified as allegedly
infringing.

The material identified as infringing in the current DMCA notice is the
presence of a "stacked time series view" and a "nested table view" in the
Pivot software. But Metamarkets owns copyright in neither a "stacked time
series view" nor a "nested table view." Instead, those are common ways of
representing data which appear in a variety of software. They are in no
way proprietary to Metamarkets.

I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial
district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise
the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will
accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA
notification or an agent of such person.

My electronic signature is below.
