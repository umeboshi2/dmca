Dear GitHub,

My name is [private] of Simple Machines, home of
the Simple Machines Forum (SMF) project.

It has come to our attention that a user/project is infringing upon our
intellectual property by having "forked" a version of our software that
does not have a permissive license.
Our work being infringed is SMF 1.1.x. (You may download a copy to
compare here:
http://download.simplemachines.org/index.php?archive;version=75)
Whilst SMF 2.x has a BSD license and can be forked without a problem
(they can even fork our repository on GitHub), SMF 1.x has a proprietary
license which does not allow forking or redistribution in any way.
Incidentally, should this have actually been a SMF 2.x fork, even then
they managed to violate the very permissive BSD license by removing
parts of our copyright and modifying copyright headers, which is against
the license and policies.

The infringing material can be found here:
https://github.com/spoficial/Spirate2.4/

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials
described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the
copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

Considering the entire repository is based upon infringed SMF 1.1.x
material, we request that you promptly remove the entire Spirate2.4
repository.
On your copyright infringement page, you request, should we have it,
contact details of the owner of the repository.
Unfortunately, we do not have any, other than a vague website that seems
to be linked in the source code: http://spirate.net/

The material is owned by:
Simple Machines
PMB #2562
2215 Renaissance Drive

Las Vegas, NV 89119

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this
notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am
authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is
allegedly infringed.

Thank you in advance for your quick action.
On behalf of Simple Machines, I would like to wish you happy holidays
and a splendid 2014.

Kind regards,
