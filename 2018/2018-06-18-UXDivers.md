The following repository contains a User Interface template kit for Microsoft’s Xamarin.Forms platform:   
https://github.com/infoAppDev/OpenUIKit

The file names of the Screens and their categories (the folders), as well as the full visual design has been copied from our product Grial UIKit. Grial UIKit is also a User Interface template kit for Xamarin.Forms platform. You can see Grial UIKit screenshots, screen names and categories here:

For instance:  
- DashboardMultipleScroll  
https://github.com/infoAppDev/OpenUIKit/blob/master/Screenshots/Image8.jpeg  
Is a copy of our DashboardMultipleScroll page  
https://grialkit.com/portfolio-items/dashboard-multiple-scroll-page/  
You can see they even kept Leonardo DiCaprio image  
- ProfilePage  
https://github.com/infoAppDev/OpenUIKit/blob/master/Screenshots/Image17.jpeg  
Is a copy of our Profile page  
https://grialkit.com/portfolio-items/profile-page/  
You can even see they kept the sample name: Richard Stainford  
- IconsDashboards  
https://github.com/infoAppDev/OpenUIKit/blob/master/Screenshots/Image2.jpeg  
Is a copy of ours IconsDashboard page  
https://grialkit.com/portfolio-items/icons-dashboard-page/  
- DocumentTimeline  
https://github.com/infoAppDev/OpenUIKit/blob/master/Screenshots/Image4.jpeg  
Is a copy our our DocumentTimeline page  
https://grialkit.com/portfolio-items/document-timeline-page/  
- ProductsGrid

Is a copy of our ProducGrid page

These are just a few examples but all the screens they provide are a copy of a screen we provide. They’ve changed the colors and usually (but not always) the application data (images and texts).

Running the code in that repo results in an application that is a clone of our sample app from a navigational standpoint (and of course, the pages are the same). Here are our iOS and Android published sample apps:

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uxdivers.grial&hl=es

We’ve kindly contact them by email asking to remove the public repo but they refused. After that email they removed their reference to Grial UIKit from their README.md file. Here is the commit:

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL:**

All pages implementation in this folder and its subfolders:  
https://github.com/infoAppDev/OpenUIKit/tree/master/CWUILibrary/CWUILibrary/Views

And the screenshots from this folder:  
https://github.com/infoAppDev/OpenUIKit/tree/master/Screenshots

The code in the pages is not a copy from our own but the design is. To stop infringing our Copyrights they need to design their own screens with their own content and sample app to have an original open UI Kit.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**
