I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.

I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.

It's MIT licensed code. The repo I forked from did not attribute the original author in the LICENSE file. I added attribution to the original author in my repo, so I'm compliant with the MIT license conditions.

Signed,
