I had the avatar/profile-picture commissioned through an online forum, MC-Market, by a user to the name of "Maytrix". Shortly afterwards, I received the image through Discord, then asked for a change which he kindly made, thus supporting the idea that he’s the creator of the image. Following the original DMCA-Takedown Notice, I contacted him about his involvement and he, as the creator, has notified me that he hasn’t opened a DMCA Takedown Notice nor authorised anyone else to on his behalf. **I** commissioned the image to be made, **he** made it for me. It seems as though the requester doesn’t have the right to request takedown of the file. I draw your attention to the attached screenshots of our conversation. I have been given full usage rights to this image.
