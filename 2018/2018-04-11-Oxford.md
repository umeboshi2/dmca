Dear Sirs/Madams

Oxford University Innovation Limited (OUI) is the owner of copyright in and patents covering RDFox software, which we currently are commercially licensing, and it has come to our attention that the code is being used on your website by a few of your users.

You will find more info about the original code here: https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/isg/tools/RDFox/.  
While we do license use of the RDFox software for academic purpose only, we reserve for OUI all commercial exploitation rights in the RDFox software.

An initial request of takedown was sent to you by [private], previously. However, whilst the user, yujiaoz, has taken the source off his main branch, the following cache, remains accessible:

https://github.com/yujiaoz/PAGOdA/tree/4a2749f8d0811f23b14065b607ec65eedfa1449e/lib/RDFox.

The following three projects also still contain the RDFox.zip which we believe contains source code:  
https://github.com/anukat2015/PAGOdA/tree/master/lib/RDFox  

https://github.com/leiloong/PAGOdA/tree/master/lib/RDFox

Yours faithfully
