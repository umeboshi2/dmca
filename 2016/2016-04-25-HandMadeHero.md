I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

In the following GitHub repository:

https://github.com/coeuvre/handmade

there exists a directory

https://github.com/coeuvre/handmade/tree/master/data

which includes, verbatim, the copyrighted art assets from the
commercial download of:

https://handmadehero.org

In order to remedy this, the user (coeuvre) must either

A) delete the entire data directory, as it contains nothing but our
copyrighted assets, or
B) make this a private repository so it cannot be accessed by the public.

I have already attempted to contact the user directly via the e-mail
address listed on their GitHub profile page, and they have neither
responded nor taken corrective action.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials
described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the
copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this
notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am
authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that
is allegedly infringed.
