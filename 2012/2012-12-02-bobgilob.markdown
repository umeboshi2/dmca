Hi Github,  

I would like to file a DMCA for the following repo  
https://github.com/diatmpravin/bobgilob .  

I sent my project to a freelancer a while ago, and he put it on
github, and i can't get hold of him so he can delete it.
The orginal repo, and all it's content is owned by me at  
[private].  

I hope this can be a minor issue as the other repo is clearly an old copy of mine, but no longer maintained or used.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials
described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this
notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am
authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that
is allegedly infringed.

Regards
