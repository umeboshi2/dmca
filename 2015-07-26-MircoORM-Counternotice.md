I have read and understand GitHub's guide to Filing a DMCA Counter Notice
I was issued with a DMCA take down notice for software in which I am the owner of.
The file in question is located here:
https://github.com/ClashGameBot/CGB/releases
The file is located inside the archive in the "lib" folder and was renamed to CGBPlugin.dll

This lib file was created by myself and my development team and is similar
to other image recognition lib files that also work with the language Autoit.

I can be contacted on one of the below methods:

My website for our project development can be found here: https://gamebot.org

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the DLL file in question has been mis identified as there are many other open sourced versions of this software that are freely available.
Myself and my fellow C# coders created this lib file to work within the programming language Autoit.

This is nothing more than a mistake on the accusers part.

I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.

Best regards,
