Dear Sirs:

We represent Iconology Inc. (the “Company”), which operates the website comixology.com, an online platform for purchasing digital comic books (“Comixology”).  It has come to the Company’s attention that numerous posts on your website are offering to the public technology to the circumvent access controls to copyrighted materials in violation of 17 U.S.C. 1201.  Several of these posts also include screenshots of copyrighted images, or the Company’s proprietary code.  By hosting such content, GitHub is violating the anti-circumvention provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, inducing and engaging in copyright infringement, and aiding and abetting violations of state and federal criminal computer access laws.  We therefore demand that GitHub immediately remove the content located at the following links, for the reasons described below:
 
https://github.com/sperglord-enterprises/comixology-backup/ - This is the main Github project that all the branched, and forked versions build from. This project contains information and tools for how to circumvent access controls. 
 
https://github.com/sperglord-enterprises/comixology-backup/blob/html5/comixology.js – This file is an entire copy of the Company’s copyrighted code.
 
All of these branches derive from the main comixology-backup project and are all differing versions that allow users to circumvent access controls:
