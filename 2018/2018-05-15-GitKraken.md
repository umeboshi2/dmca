**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf?**  
Yes.  

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**  
I work at Axosoft where we develop GitKraken. Our work is not open source, and is released at https://www.gitkraken.com/. We do not permit or grant licenses to modifiy our application. There is a user https://github.com/KillWolfVlad who has continued to post cracking software for GitKraken at https://github.com/KillWolfVlad/GitKraken-Pro-AUR. It seems the entire purpose of this repository is to bypass payment for our product and unlock features that would otherwise be inaccessible in the application. Further, the repository in question even goes so far as to automate the cracking process and rerelease GitKraken. They are now releasing cracked copies of GitKraken via GitHub.

Here are a few examples of github hosting cracked copies of GitKraken:

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**  
Our work is not open source.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**  
Removal is the best solution. These repositories are clearly nothing but an effort to crack, modify, and rerelease our product without the permission of Axosoft.
