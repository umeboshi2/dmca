This project:  
https://github.com/antons701/Appear-Fullsource

has taken proprietary source code from a private code repository and is
offering it as a GitHub project.

In special the following images and references to our apps (Apper) and
websites are used

https://itunes.apple.com/app/id900132614?mt=8  
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xpous.myapps  
https://igenapps.com/  

Some of the references with our name iGenApps or the Apper name are:  
https://github.com/antons701/Appear-Fullsource/blob/master/Apper/Resources/fonts/iGenApps.ttf  
https://github.com/antons701/Appear-Fullsource/blob/master/Apper/Resources/images/default-icon.png  
https://github.com/antons701/Appear-Fullsource/blob/master/Apper/Apper.swift  

ItÂ´s the second time this developer does something like this. He has stolen
the source code and is offering it without our permission.

The first time he tried it with https://github.com/antons701/iGenApp/ as
selling. Which we had taken down. Now he made it public without our
permission. The code contains parts of a new version of our App Apper.

Please remove this complete project immediately.
