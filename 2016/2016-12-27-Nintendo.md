**What work was allegedly infringed? If possible, please provide a URL:**  
The freeShop application provided at https://github.com/Cruel/freeShop/releases infringes Nintendo's copyrights, because the application circumvents Nintendo's technological protection measures in violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Nintendo encrypts the game files available from its eShop servers to prevent users from accessing those files without paying for them. Nintendo believes the freeShop application circumvents Nintendo's protection measures by decrypting the game files accessible from its eShop servers, allowing freeShop users to access and play Nintendo's eShop games for free.

The freeShop application also contains unauthorized copies of the Nintendo 3DS Logo Data file, covered by U.S. Copyright Reg. No. PA0001781880, which further infringes Nintendo's rights.

In addition, the files located at the links below violate the GitHub Terms of Service by facilitating the theft of Nintendo's games from its eShop servers, and the use of these files with a Nintendo 3DS device violates the user's obligations under Nintendo's end-user license agreement.
