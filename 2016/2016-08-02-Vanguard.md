Hello,

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

Code available here https://github.com/laravelish/EasyAdmin is actually one
of my items called "Vanguard" available on CodeCanyon marketplace (
http://codecanyon.net/item/vanguard-advanced-php-login-and-user-management/14521866)
and it is not released under open source licence.

This user just modified the frontend theme that comes with Vanguard,
modified few things inside the source and made everything public.
As you can see when you open that CodeCanyon link from above, Vanguard is
released on January 21, more than a month before this "EasyAdmin" is
released. Also, I won Envato Most Wanted Contest with Vanguard, which can
be verified here:  
https://forums.envato.com/t/most-wanted-winners-laravel/32303

More than 95% of source code is the same, written in Laravel PHP framework,
and even documentation looks almost the same. Here is the original Vanguard
documentation https://docs.vanguardapp.io/ (which is actually public and
can be found on my GitHub profile: https://github.com/loshmis/vanguard-docs)
and this is documentation for "EasyAdmin" script http://docs.laravelish.com/

Here is the link to Vanguard's source code, so you can compare the codebase
too: [private]
