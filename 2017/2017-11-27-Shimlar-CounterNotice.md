Shimlar was created in 2001 by [private] (aka Toshax) and myself, with the help of a German php coder [private] and an American linux guru [private]. The game ran until 2007 and led to several spin offs. I open sourced the code some years ago, a few former players decided to revive the game and clean up the code. What runs at the moment on shimlar.com is a far better version of the original code. Furthermore, I frequently speak with the owner of shimlar.com/.org - they never mentioned anything about this code.
The name "shimlar" was invented by [private] back in 2001. We stopped paying for the hosting and url in 2007 when I closed down the game.
