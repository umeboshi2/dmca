Re: DMCA Notification

Dear Github DMCA Agent:

We Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, "FIS").

We have recently discovered at Github.com the unauthorized publication, disclosure, and copying of FIS's confidential and copyrighted material. Under the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. รยง 512), FIS provides this notification of claimed infringement. Please immediately remove all folders and files at the URL locations below:

https://github.com/pravasna/pravasna/tree/master/eaccess/

https://github.com/pravasna/pravasna/tree/master/discovery/

https://github.com/xqf309/pravasna/tree/master/eaccess/

https://github.com/xqf309/pravasna/tree/master/discovery/

These folders and files contain copyrighted FIS materials. For example, software code files within these locations contain the text "Copyright (c) Fidelity Information Services, Inc. 2009, All right reserved," and "Any unauthorized access, use, duplication, or disclosure is unlawful."

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. I have a good faith belief that distribution of the materials described above is not authorized by FIS, its agents, or the law. I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am authorized to act on FIS's behalf.

Thank you for your assistance.
