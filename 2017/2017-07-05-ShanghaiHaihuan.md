His action has infringed the copyright of my company. his account as below:
sunder-xie.

And several forks which copy my repository indirectly, we could not identify them since their accounts are invisible to me. I wish you help me identify their accounts and delete their cloning codes immediately.
All those work are internal codes and core property of my company, none of them are open source code. Because of my personal operation mistake, I uploaded those codes to Github.
Identity the copiers no matter directly or indirectly, and delete their cloing codes immediately, and send them serious notice that any copy or modification is strictly prohibited, otherwise they would face legal suing of my company who if final owner of the copyright.

They didn't provide contact information under their accounts.
