Re: Infringement of GPL licensed Software

I have read and understand Github’s Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

Copyrighted Materials: https://github.com/PufferPanel/Scales

As of https://github.com/PufferPanel/Scales/commit/854270ba5d3bd0d47a3472b9231b5e4e4bc7b25f the repository listed above (namely the “rework” branch) is infringing upon my work by removing my name as the original author of the software within the repository which is a violation of the GPL v3 license that it is licensed under.

I request that the above commit be disabled and the repository update the file to reflect the author of the program correctly. The alleged infringer is the ‘PufferPanel’ organization and GitHub user ‘LordRalex’ who committed the changes.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
