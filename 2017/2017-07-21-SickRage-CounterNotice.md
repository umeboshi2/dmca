**Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?**  

I have already made the changes, adding the ORIGINAL copyright holder back to the license as it was originally provided and adding my name underneath his as credit for later contributions as per convention.
The original author and actual copyright holder finds these changes agreeable, whereas the complainant has no standing.

As such, all other claims are disputed for this DMCA. We are in compliance with all applicable law to the best of our knowledge.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake? (optional)**  

The original copyright holder is against this takedown, and has expressed disappointment that @ech3lon would submit this DMCA takedown claiming to own the copyright.

The original copyright holder is @midgetspy ([private], [private], from the parent fork https://github.com/midgetspy/Sick-Beard/blob/development/COPYING.txt)

Very little if any code is shared among these forks, however if complainant would like a prior credit added that would be amenable.
