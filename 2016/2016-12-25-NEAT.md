__Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.__

I believe there are no forks of the infringing repositories.

__Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?__

NEAT is released under the GNU General Public License. This requires that derivative works contain a prominent and appropriate copyright notice, and that changes from the original are identified with dates. The codes "proEQUIB" and "pyEQUIB" are translations of NEAT into IDL and python respectively, but [private] who created these repositories violated the terms of the GPL by passing the codes off as his own original work. When challenged, he added partial copyright information on some files, but continued to pass off large sections of the codes as his own original work, and created fictitious revision histories for other files. At no point has either code contain an appropriate and prominent copyright notice indicating that it is based on NEAT.

Violations of the GPL automatically result in a termination of the user's license. The license may be restored provisionally if the user ceases all violation, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates the license. In December 2016, [private] remained in violation of the license, and I advised him that I was explicitly and finally terminating his license to reuse NEAT code, under Section 8 of the GPL. The code nevertheless is still being hosted by github.

__What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?__

The license was explicitly and finally terminated. All code based on NEAT must be removed.

__Do you have the alleged infringer's contact information? If so, please provide it:__

[Private] -[Private] - [Private] - [Private] - github usernames "danehkar" and "equib"
