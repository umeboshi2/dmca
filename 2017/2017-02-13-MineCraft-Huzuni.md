__Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?__

Yes. [Private] and I [Private] are the original authors.

__What work was allegedly infringed? If possible, please provide a URL:__

https://bitbucket.org/halalaboos/huzuni-final/src/8a99d697bcf3ec6157f2c9cbc7c6dbb497c1bf67/vFINALmc1.10.2/?at=master

__What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository's URL:__

https://github.com/MatthewSH/minecraft-Huzuni

__Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.__

https://github.com/CheerioFX/minecraft-Huzuni

https://github.com/Dampen59/minecraft-Huzuni

__Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?__

The code was posted publicly on Bitbucket without an open source license. The user created a repository with our code, included a donation link for themselves to profit off of, and refused to communicate when given the opportunity to solve this issue. We have since moved the project to Github with a temporary license which his repository also violates.

Public communication regarding this was also quickly taken down, see: https://github.com/MatthewSH/minecraft-Huzuni/issues/5

__What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?__

At this point, I have given them enough opportunities to settle this problem, and would just like the repository removed before he takes anything further.

__Do you have the alleged infringer's contact information? If so, please provide it:__
