We have already experienced a compromise with our ISubpoena server located
at amazon AWS. It was determined that the publicly released API key was used
to hack into our server.

Here is the Amazon support summary after their investigation:

Hello,

Thank you for contacting AWS Premium support. I am [private] and It was a
pleasure conversing with you today.

I understand that you were trying to know what has caused the account to be
compromised.

We have found out that your Root access keys([Private]) were
compromised. I See that you have deleted the compromised keys and created
new keys and also have changed your password and activated MFA on your root
account as a security measure.

We request that the repositories be deleted from [private]¹s Github account.
We will be moving towards legal action.
