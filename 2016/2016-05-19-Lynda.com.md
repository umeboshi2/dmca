Dear GitHub:

I, the undersigned, confirm under penalty of perjury that I am an authorized agent of lynda.com and/or its subsidiaries and affiliated companies and am authorized to act on lynda.com behalf in this matter.

I am writing to notify you of the infringement of lynda.com intellectual property rights on your site as identified below and demand that you take immediate action to permanently stop the infringing conduct. The github user has created a plugin that exploits the lynda.com video viewer and management software to allow downloading of copyrighted videos. The plugin software code likely copies Lynda software code to do this, which is itself a copyright violation. This uploaded plugin also violates section 1201 of the Digital Milleneum Copyright Act because it circumvents lynda.com's copyright protection systems and induces users to infringe lynda.com's copyrights. The subject plugin also violates lynda.com's terms of use, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and potentially other laws.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. On behalf of lynda.com, I demand that you immediately remove and disable these links / files. To the extent that multiple different copies of the infringed copyrighted work identified in the subject line above can be found on and through your service, you are required to act expeditiously to remove or disable access to all such infringing copies. I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

This email is not a complete statement of lynda.com rights in connection with this matter, and nothing contained herein constitutes an express or implied waiver of any rights, remedies, or defenses of lynda.com in connection with this matter, all of which are expressly reserved.

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

I may be contacted at:

Sincerely,
