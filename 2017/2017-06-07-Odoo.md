**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  

Yes, none of the forks seem to have pulled this yet.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**  

Yes - AGPL-3. They are in violation of license - attribution headers are stripped, and repo is licensed LGPL-3.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**  

The user of this repo would need to completely rewrite the functionality of these files, or release the repo under compatible license terms of AGPL-3. AGPL-3 also requires that the attribution is maintained, which requires that the attribution/licensing headers that were stripped from the original files are maintained.

**Do you have the alleged infringer's contact information? If so, please provide it:**  

The Github user is CybroOdoo. They have not responded to emails sent to [private]
