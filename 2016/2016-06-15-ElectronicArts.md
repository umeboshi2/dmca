Re: Electronic Arts - Copyright Infringement

Dear DMCA Agent:

I write on behalf of Electronic Arts Inc. ("EA"). It has come to our attention that a website hosted by you, www.github.com (the "Site"), contains material that infringes copyrights owned or controlled by EA.

Specifically, an unauthorized copy of code from EA's FIFA video game is displayed on the Site. Pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"), 17 U.S.C. Section 512(c), we demand that you immediately and permanently disable and/or block access to the infringing material, specifically located at: https://github.com/brrcat/repo/tree/master/apitimer and https://github.com/brrcat/repo/tree/master/FakeService. To be clear, we demand that the entire contents of these folders be disabled or blocked.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. Upon information and belief, the infringer's email address is [private] and his/her GitHub username is "brrcat." EA has previously attempted to contact the infringer regarding removal of this code and has not received a response.

This letter is not intended to be a full statement of the facts, and it does not prejudice or waive any claim, whether in law or in equity, that EA may have with respect to this matter or any other matter.

If you have any questions concerning this matter, please contact our IP enforcement group at [private].

Yours Truly,

[private]

Electronic Arts Inc.
