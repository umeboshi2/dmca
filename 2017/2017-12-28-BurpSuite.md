PortSwigger Ltd is the copyright owner of Burp Suite Professional and as the [private] of Burp Suite Professional I am authorised to act on its behalf.

We believe the files at the URL listed below should be taken down as this is a tool that allows people to crack our product Burp Suite Professional and use it without a license:

The work allows violation of the license for Burp Suite Professional.

The only solution is removal of all the files and material at these repositories.

We do not have the alleged infringersâ€™ contact information.

I have a good faith belief that use of the materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner of Burp Suite Professional, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
