RE:	DMCA	Takedown	Notice for	microsoft.github.io  

My	name	is	[Private]	and	I	am	the	[Private]	of	Straight	North,	LLC.	

A	website	that	your company	hosts	is	infringing	on	at	least	one	copyright	owned	by	my	company. Content	from	our	corporate	website	was	copied	onto	your	servers	without	permission.	The	original	website,	to	which	we	own	the	exclusive	
copyrights,	can	be	found	at:	https://www.straightnorth.com/services/email-marketing/optimization/

The	unauthorized	and	infringing	copy	can	be	found	at:

https://microsoft.github.io/r-server-campaign-optimization/

*see	following	page	for	screenshot	of	the	infringing	content

This	letter	is	official	notification	under	Section	512(c)	of	the	Digital	Millennium	Copyright	Act	(”DMCA”) that I	
seek	the	removal	of	the	aforementioned	infringing	material	from	your	servers.	I	request	that	you	immediately	
notify	the	infringer	of	this	notice	and	inform	them	of	their	duty	to	remove	the	infringing	material	immediately,	
and	notify	them	to	cease	any	further	posting	of	infringing	material	to	your	server	in	the	future.

Please	also	be	advised	that	the	law	requires	you,	as	a	service	provider,	to	remove	or	disable	access	to	the	
infringing	materials	upon	receiving	this	notice.	Under	U.S. law	a	service	provider,	such	as	yourself,	enjoys	
immunity	from	a	copyright	lawsuit	if you	act	with	deliberate	speed	to	investigate	and	rectify	ongoing	copyright	
infringement.	If	service	providers	do	not	investigate	and	remove	or	disable	the	infringing	material, this	immunity	
is	lost.	Therefore,	for you	to	remain	immune	from	a	copyright	infringement	action, you	will	need	to	investigate	
and	ultimately	remove	or	otherwise	disable	the	infringing	material	from	your	servers	with	all	due	speed	should	
the	direct	infringer,	your	client,	not	comply	immediately.

I	have	a	good	faith	belief	that	use	of	the	copyrighted	materials	described	above	as	allegedly	infringing	is	not	
authorized	by	the	copyright	owner,	its	agent,	or	the	law. I	have	taken	fair	use	into	consideration. I	swear,	under	
penalty	of	perjury,	that	the	information	in	this notification	is	accurate	and	that	I	am	the	copyright	owner	or	am	
authorized	to	act	on	behalf	of	the	owner	of	an	exclusive	right	that	is	allegedly	infringed.
Should	you	wish	to	discuss	this, please	contact	me	directly.

Thank	you,
