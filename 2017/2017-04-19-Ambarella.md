Ambarella provides software design kits (SDKs) to its customers under limited license and confidentiality terms. Two of those SDKs, here the SDKs for Ambarella’s “S2L” chip and “A5S” chip, have been publicly posted to Github in violation of those license and confidentiality terms.

__Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.__

Yes, forks are included in the list above.

__Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?__

The SDKs include a mix of open source and proprietary software which are not easily separated. The portion that is open source is subject to licenses such as GPL, LGPL, BSD, and others. Regardless of the open source portion, the proprietary portion is being publicly posted without authorization.


__What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?__ 

Best solution would be removal of the identified code.
