Re: Electronic Arts - Copyright Infringement

Dear DMCA Agent:

I write on behalf of Electronic Arts Inc. ("EA"). It has come to our attention that a website hosted by you, www.github.com (the "Site"), contains material that infringes copyrights owned or controlled by EA. Specifically, an unauthorized copies of code that sensitive information about EA's infrastructure is displayed on the Site.

Pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"), 17 U.S.C. Section 512(c), we demand that you immediately and permanently disable and/or block access to the infringing material, specifically located at:

* https://github.com/siren0413/py-logsearch/blob/master/main.yaml

* https://github.com/siren0413/Python/blob/master/config.properties  
* https://github.com/siren0413/Python/blob/master/Test/test.py  
* https://github.com/cybercharger/OnlineSchemaChange

To be clear, we request all of the content in the above links be deleted.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. Upon information and belief, the alleged infringers' GitHub usernames are siren0413, cybercharger and chrismao87.

This letter is not intended to be a full statement of the facts, and it does not prejudice or waive any claim, whether in law or in equity, that EA may have with respect to this matter or any other matter.
