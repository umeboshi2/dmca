Dear GirHub DMCA Team

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice and we would like to humbly state that we are the owners of the account with GitHub by the name of eigital (https://github.com/eigital) and eigital labs (https://github.com/eigitallabs).

An ex-employee of ours by the name of Mr. [private] has taken our code he partially worked upon downloaded it from [private] and from [private] and illegally posted it on his Public profile at https://github.com/ngocanh68/epaisa-share whereby infringing and pirating our code and referring it back to our website and encouraging people to hack us further.

User ID of Infringer: ngocanh68

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Thanking You.

Yours Truly,
