Dear GitHub copyright team,

we're selling two assets on the Unity asset store - uTomate and Scene
Manager. We've found that these assets have been made publicly available
through several GitHub repositories, even though this violates the asset
store end user agreement under which these assets are distributed.

Where possible we tried to settle the issue with the repository holders by
opening an issue against their repository, however several holders have not
answered to our requests or could not be contacted at all. We therefore see
no other way than filing a DMCA notice to have the content removed from the
publicly available repositories.

I will proceed according to your checklist in the following.

1. Include the following statement: "I have read and understand GitHub's
Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice."

  I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

2. Identify the copyrighted work you believe has been infringed
uTomate - available for sale at
https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/#!/content/7703 and SceneManager -
available for sale at https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/2732.
These packages are sold there (and only there) under the
asset store end user license agreement (https://unity3d.com/legal/as_terms),
which permits the buyer to use these assets
as part of their game development. The license specifically prohibits
distribution of these assets in any other form than
as integrated components of electronic games and interactive media.
(Section 2.2).

3. Identify the material that you allege is infringing the copyrighted work
listed in item #2, above.
