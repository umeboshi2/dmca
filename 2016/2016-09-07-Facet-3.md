Re: DMCA Takedown Notice For https://github.com/MobPartner/pivot-public

To Whom It May Concern:

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

I am writing to request that Github take down the project at the following
link: https://github.com/MobPartner/pivot-public.

This project infringes the copyright of Metamarkets Group, Inc. in the
proprietary, interactive visualization software called Facet, described at
https://metamarkets.com/2015/introducing-facet/. Facet was developed
internally at Metamarkets and Metamarkets holds the copyright thereto.
Facet is only available to Metamarkets customers who purchase a license to
use Facet.

An explanation of how and why Pivot infringes Metamarkets’ copyright in its
proprietary Facet software can be found in Metamarkets’ August 24, 2016
DMCA notice to Github (viewable at
https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2016/2016-08-31-Facet.md, and
incorporated herein by reference), which was processed with a takedown of
Pivot on September 1, 2016.

The project found at https://github.com/MobPartner/pivot-public is a fork
of the infringing Pivot repository, and entirely duplicates version 0.9.13
of Pivot, which includes the infringing elements of Pivot referenced in
Metamarkets’ August 24, 2016 DMCA notice regarding Pivot.

This infringing fork of Pivot is causing immense harm to Metamarkets.
Facet is Metamarkets’ flagship proprietary SaaS product. Imply Data has
impermissibly copied its structure, sequence and organization in the form
of Pivot, which Imply Data then improperly open sourced on Github, and
which other users then forked. This entire fork of the Pivot repository
must be taken down immediately in order to prevent further infringement of
Facet, and further harm to Metamarkets.

I have a good faith belief that use of the materials described above on the
infringing web pages are not authorized by Metamarkets Group, Inc., or its
agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this
notification is accurate and that I am authorized to act on behalf of the
owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Sincerely,

[private]
