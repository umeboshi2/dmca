I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. The infringing material are two typeface (font) families hosted on Github by user @tivnwvng. The entire repo “mxw” is just infringing material from us and other typeface designers and copyright owners like Adobe and Monotype.

GT Haptik infringing material: https://github.com/tivnwvng/mxw/tree/master/Fonts/Haptik

GT Pressura infringing material: https://github.com/tivnwvng/mxw/tree/master/Fonts/Pressura

The user needs to delete at least the two folders containing our fonts illegally. Optimally you’d just delete the whole repo, as it’s all illegal material the user probably intends (or intended) to share with others.
