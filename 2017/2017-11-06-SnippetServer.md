**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

I'm the copyright owner, as I wrote code that was stolen and not paid for, according to an agreement between the owner of the original owner and myself.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

This is the original repo:

https://github.com/imnvr/SnippetServer

This is my fork:

https://github.com/damoncasale/SnippetServer

There were several submitted pull requests to the original repo, contingent on a promise to pay by the original repo owner. The owner failed to pay and deleted his Reddit account. Therefore I am claiming copyright over the code I wrote and asking for the original repo to be taken down until such time as payment is made and proof is submitted to that effect.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository's URL:**

https://github.com/imnvr/SnippetServer

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

The original code is unlicensed.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**

The owner of the code can make the agreed-upon payment. I have a Skype chat history that I can provide with details of that agreement.

**Do you have the alleged infringer's contact information? If so, please provide it:**

His Skype username is [Private].

**Type (or copy and paste) the following statement: "I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration."**

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
