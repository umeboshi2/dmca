My name is [private]. I work in a team that handles public disclosure or any other disclosure, either authorized or unauthorized, related to our company. A website that your company hosts, according to our cooperative partner Huawei Ltd, is infringing on at least one copyright owned by my company. This causes great concerns to my company as we firmly believe the alleged contents are being publicized without our authorization.

Those systems includes Customer Relationship Management System (CRM), Business Intelligence System (BI), Clearing System (CS), Scenic Area Management System, mobile ecommence platform, Travel Web, Ticketing System etc. As those systems were originally designed by my company - Mopon Ltd, we thus own original work exclusive rights to both income and outcome of the works, including all the codes that were used in those systems, and we remains rights to its use and distribution. Therefore, any unauthorized copy or publication of our works will be treated as violation of the Copyright Act.
During the testing, we found couples of files was uploaded onto your servers without permission. And we believe those files (various codes contained) are direct, literal copy of my company’s work.The original files, to which we own the exclusive copyrights, can be found at-
