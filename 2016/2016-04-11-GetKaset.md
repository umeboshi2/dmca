Dear GitHub,

My project [private] has been forked without my permission by user 280Rubys (https://github.com/280Rubys/getkaset-webapp) and WebhookGit (https://github.com/WebhookGit/getkaset-webapp). This might have happened because my project was set to public for a period by mistake. I made the repository private as soon as I could as it contains sensitive data which can be damaging if left available to the public. I cannot contact the offending user as they did not leave any contact information.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

========================================

Yours Sincerely,
