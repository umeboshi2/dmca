I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

My name is [private] and I work for the Pirates Online Retribution
organization.
Unfortunately, our GitHub repositories were stolen and reuploaded with no
access logs on GitHub being available.

We've migrated our current Git repositories to [private]. Therefore, the original
repositories have been deleted, but records still remain on the GitHub
system.

The infringing content can be found on these repositories:  
#1 https://github.com/xseano/PORDependencies  
(original repositories: [private])  
#2 https://github.com/xseano/PORManagementScripts  
(original repositories: [private])  
#3 https://github.com/xseano/PORWebSource  
(original repositories: [private])  
#4 https://github.com/xseano/PORGameSource  
(original repositories:  
[private])  
#5 https://github.com/xseano/PORLaunchers  
(original repositories: [private])

I claim ownership on all of my (darktohka's) commits. These repositories
are a blatant public reupload of the original private repositories.

I would have all of my content removed from these repos. I have looked into
each of these repositories seperately.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described
above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner,
or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this
notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am
authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is
allegedly infringed.

Please redact my signature and the information about the new repositories.

Thank you,

[private]
