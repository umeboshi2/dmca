No, I want to dispute this.  

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake? (optional)**  
Well, first of all, the source was release to the public on MediaFire as seen here:   http://www.mediafire.com/file/h8i90zno6stwqhg/Toontown+Ultimate+Adventure+Test+Alpha+v1.2.7.rar & https://i.gyazo.com/7dc5abf9e8904ca11814a1d70578953d.png The source is also a fork of Toontown Stride which is open source here: https://github.com/LittleNed/ToontownStride The statement of "Toontown Ultimate Adventure was a closed source game" and that they ILLEGALLY POSTED IT is total baloney because the code was released open source already. If you want more prove, here you go:
[redacted]  
[redacted]  

Also the statement that the person that summited the claim wrote that HE owns the copyright is also baloney because it's actually Disney and Schell Games that owns the original code that they use for Toontown Online before it got shut down in 2013 as seen here:  
[redacted]   
Besides that the "This made my entire team freak out, and we have 4 Staff leaves. We just want this gone, because it is running our reputation" even though i'm 99% sure its a lie, if true, proves that they are unprofessional at keeping there cool, that they cant handle criticism and are not capable of running a MMO. Also, i know this is off topic, but what the heck is a "Staff leaves"?
