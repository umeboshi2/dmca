1. I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Counter
Notice.

2. Regarding the contested content at  
https://github.com/librenms/librenms/commit/ac4eba78e48362d6d64e4695afb849d6d7ec531e

3. My contact details are as follows:  
[private]

4. I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that
the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or
misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.

It is my opinion that the complainant hasn't provided enough information to
ascertain the nature of the claim. The code on Github and in the links
provided bear no resemblance to each other.

Whilst I do not believe that the graph_types arrays in
includes/defintions.inc.php constitute copyrightable material, they are
unused in our code and have been removed.

5. I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial
district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise
the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will
accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA
notification or an agent of such person.

6. Please see below signature.
