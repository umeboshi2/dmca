Hello, the following site contains a module for my software FreeSWITCH that
violates the MPL License it was released under. The poster put this module up
and did not follow the license.

In addition the repo contains a copy of unauthorized G729 code which is
protected by patent by Sipro. see: <http://www.sipro.com/g7291_about.php>

We sell a similar module to to this one legally and by allowing this module to
exist it puts us in jeopardy. The code combines this unauthorized G729 code
with the non-compliant code from my software and it constitutes an illegal act.
They are simply using your site as a means of distribution. Clearly it's never
been edited and only is used to access the files.

As you can see my name even appears in the file:

<https://github.com/Deepwalker/fs_itu_g729/blob/master/mod_g729.c>

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described
above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or
its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is
accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf
of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
