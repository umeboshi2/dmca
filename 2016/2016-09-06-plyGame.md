I am the owner of the product in question.

plyGame is included in a project on github. This is a commercial product and redistribution in the form as present in the repo is not allowed. https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/9694

The complete plyoung folder should be removed from this repo. https://github.com/TetianaFilonenko/school_simulation/tree/master/Assets/plyoung

The rest of the repo might include products from other Unity Asset Store products, for example Dialoguer, but I am not the owner of those.

The product is not under any open source license.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
