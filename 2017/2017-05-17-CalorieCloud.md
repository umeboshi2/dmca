I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Calorie Cloud is a private company. We host all our application source code on Github at https://github.com/CalorieCloud/

Github user jprime1991 has copied six of our private repositories and published them publicly on Github in their entirety, including private API keys to external services. Our original private repositories are at:

[private]

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository's URL:**  

The following repositories, hosted by PrimeWebProjects, are direct, unauthorized copies of our source code. It appears that the only change the user has made is removing our Readme files. The entire repositories are infringing and should be removed:

- https://github.com/PrimeWebProjects/kph_web_app  
- https://github.com/PrimeWebProjects/kph_main  
- https://github.com/PrimeWebProjects/kpc_main  
- https://github.com/PrimeWebProjects/cc_main  
- https://github.com/PrimeWebProjects/cc_email_templates  
- https://github.com/PrimeWebProjects/cc_backend_worker  

You can compare these to our original projects (listed in the above section).

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes. At this time, it appears that there are no forks of the infringing repos.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No. These projects are the property of Calorie Cloud and have not been licensed for distribution or reuse.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**

Removal is the only option.

**Do you have the alleged infringer's contact information? If so, please provide it:**

The user published the repos under github user jprime1991 and email [private]. Online searches reveal no further information about this user.
