**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**  
  
Yep!  
  
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**  
  
This is the sales page for [private] book which includes the detailed description of the copyrighted material:  
  
https://www.pyimagesearch.com/practical-python-opencv/  
  
[private] blog is PyImageSearch.com. [private] book, Practical Python and OpenCV, (along with books by other authors) are currently being hosted on GitHub:  
  
https://github.com/rainer85ah/CV/tree/master/Books  
  
**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository's URL:**  
  
The `rainer85ah` user appears to be hosting a lot of copyrighted books:  
  
https://github.com/rainer85ah/CV/tree/master/Books  
  
In particular, here is a direct link to [private] book:  
  
https://github.com/rainer85ah/CV/blob/master/Books/Practical%20Python%20and%20OpenCV%20by%20Adrian%20Rosebrock.pdf  
  
**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  
  
Yes, please see this repo as well:  
  
https://github.com/xf0e/practical_python_and_opencv  
  
While it's certainly not GitHub's fault that the files were hosted illegally (nor what I ever imply that it is), may I ask for a feature request? If it's possible in the future, could file hashes of DMCA content be indexed and then use to lookup against new files submitted to GitHub?  
  
I imagine that might be a computational impossibility but it's just a suggestion.  
  
**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**  
  
No, it's not an open source license.  
  
**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**  
  
The best solution would be to remove the copyrighted material.  
  
**Do you have the alleged infringer's contact information? If so, please provide it:**  
  
I have tried to contact them via their Twitter (the only way I could find them). They did not respond. Here is a link to a screenshot of me trying to contact them:
