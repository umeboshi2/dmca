To Whom It May Concern:

On behalf of Verimatrix, Inc. (the “Owner”), I am authorized to send this notice of copyright infringement.  As required under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act [17 USC 512(c)(3)], I am instructed to place you on notice that:

1.	The owner is the exclusive owner of the copyrights in and to the VCAS software and related files and documentation, which is designed and used as technological measures to effectively control access to copyrighted television signals (singly and collectively, the “Verimatrix Material”):

2.	The Owner is injured by a violation of the U.S. Copyright laws, in particular section(s) 1201(a)(2) and/or 1201(b)(1) of Title 17 of the United States Code, commonly referred to as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, or "DMCA", as well as Articles 29a (2) of the Dutch Copy Right Act (Dutch: "Auteurswet"). 

3.	The following web pages (the “Infringing Material”) contain files to circumvent the technological measures of the Verimatrix Material that effectively controls access to copyrighted television signals, and thus also contains unauthorized copies of the Verimatrix Material or unauthorized derivative works of the Verimatrix Material which infringe the Verimatrix Material and the exclusive rights of the Owner:

    https://github.com/The-Priest-NL/vm_api

4.	Providing access to the file-downloads at the Infringing Material qualifies as trafficking a device that circumvents effective access controls and/or trafficking a device that circumvents effective copyright protection measures.

5.	Please immediately remove or disable all access to the file-downloads found at the Infringing Material.  

6.	I have a good faith belief that the use of the Infringing Material is not authorized by the Owner, its agents or the law because, among other things, the files circumvent technological measures that effectively controls access to copyrighted television signals.  

7.	The information in this Notice of Copyright Infringement is accurate and is provided under penalty of perjury.  I am authorized to act on behalf of the Owner.

8.	For any questions or additional information, my contact details are:
