Hi,

We have become aware that the following URL:

https://github.com/sgh1986915/php-oop-mvc-unbeatablecar

Contains a complete upload of a proprietary software application developed by Invent Partners.

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

We suspect that this has been uploaded by disgruntled offshore contractor with whom we had a dispute earlier this year. He appears to have simply uploaded his copy of the entire codebase he was working on to Github.

If you inspect the code, you will find numerous references to our organisation therein, and you will note that a large number of the class prefixes begin "Inv" denoting "Invent Partners"

This has the potential to do significant commercial harm to our company, and we would request that you remove this repository from your server immediately.

The contractor (if it is indeed who I think it is) was suspended from [private] for fraudulent activity, at which point we ceased working with him. He them attempted to extort money for work not carried out, asking us to pay into a Chinese Company's Paypal account. He continuted to harass us for some time. It would appear that when this tactic failed, he has set out to do the maximum amount of commercial damage to the company.

It is entirely possible that the other repositories uploaded by user sgh1986915 are also not his work. I am informed that he had been working with a number of different organisations on [private] and had defrauded more than one of them.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
