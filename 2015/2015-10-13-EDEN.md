Dear Sir/Madam,

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

All of the code in the following public repo:

https://github.com/gtejaswini/EDEN

is a public, direct, literal copy of my company's copyrighted source code
in the repo:

[private]

We request that GitHub remove the entire repository at
https://github.com/gtejaswini/EDEN as soon as possible, and notify us of
its removal.

The GitHub user 'gtejaswini' was a member of an outsourcing team,
contracted to work with this codebase in 2011. This user created an
unauthorized public repo of this codebase, in violation of our copyright.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described
above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner,
or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this
notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am
authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is
allegedly infringed.

Sincerely,

[private]
