Dear Sir/Madam,

My name is [private] and I am an attorney-at-law with Han Kun Law Offices, a law firm in the People’s Republic of China. I am writing to you on behalf of my client 百度在线网络技术(北京)有限公司（Baidu Online Network Technology (Beijing) Co., Ltd hereinafter “Baidu”). A website that your company hosts, GitHub.com, is infringing on several copyrights owned by Baidu.

We identified that several documents/links are copied onto your servers without Baidu's authorization or permission. Said documents/links are directed to copies of Baidu’s product code or product development code, which have never been published. Baidu owns the exclusive copyrights to all of such documents and/or the contents directed by the links. Besides, the above-described code also contain trade secret of Baidu.

The specific unauthorized and infringing copies of the documents or links can be found in the list in Appendix I of this letter. Please immediately remove and/or disable access to all contents/links identified in Appendix I.

Please be advised that this letter also constitutes our official notification under Section 512(c) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”). We seek immediate removal of the aforementioned infringing materials from your servers. We also request that you immediately notify the infringer(s) of this notice and inform them of their duty to remove the infringing materials immediately, and notify them to cease any further posting of infringing materials to your server in the future.

Please also be advised that the law requires you, as a service provider, to remove or disable access to the infringing materials upon receiving this notice. Under the U.S. law a service provider, such as yourself, enjoys immunity from a copyright lawsuit provided that you act expeditiously to investigate and rectify the ongoing copyright infringement. The immunity is lost if service providers do not investigate and remove or disable the infringing material.

We provide this notice in good faith and with the reasonable belief that rights Baidu owns are being infringed. Under penalty of perjury I certify that the information contained in the notification is both true and accurate, and I have the authority to act on behalf of Baidu, the owner of the copyright(s) involved.

Should you wish to discuss this with me, please contact me directly. My email address is [private], and my phone number is [private]. Thank you.

Best,

[private]
