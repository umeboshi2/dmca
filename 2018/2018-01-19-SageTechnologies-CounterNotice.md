Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?  
I want to dispute the integrity of the notice filed against the repository, and I am willing to only remove the filler's name, of which he said the repository contains without his permission.  

Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake? (optional)  
The notice filed states that the code belongs to the company because of my resignation from the company in October and therefore all intellectual property made by me belongs to the company. What the notice failed to address was that the code in Jeamz/Droplet was created prior to the formation of the legal company entity--as noted by the date stamps of all files of code in the repo--therefore any intellectual property I created prior to the company's formation is not a legal asset of the entity. It was not created on "company time". Furthermore there are no legal documents stating that I must relinquish the intellectual property upon resignation or that any software created under "company time" belongs to the company--although both parties in this situation are under the age [redacted] and classify as [redacted], meaning that we can not enter into legally binding documents. The DMCA takedown filler has also failed to substantiate any approved and valid copyrights of the files stored in the accused repo--writing "copyright Sage" does not make it valid. This failure to abide by DMCA guidelines and sending multiple misleading DMCA takedowns is considered perjury and harassment, none of which will be tolerated and can be acted upon legally.
