**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**  
Yes.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**  
emoji-picker adds a small menu for selecting emojis available on the website plug.dj (https://github.com/Burkes/emoji-picker)

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository's URL:**  
https://github.com/NiceATC/pp-AMMBR/blob/master/teste02.js

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  
I have already submitted 2 DMCAs, one they complied with on the same repository and the second was forced action by GitHub. They repeated the same thing, obfuscating my code without any credit.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**  
GNU General Public License v3.0, section 5:
" a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
it, and giving a relevant date.

b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
released under this License and any conditions added under section"
It is not being released under the same license and it does not carry notices that it is a modification instead of an original creation.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**
Request the user to either FORK my repository and keep LICENSE and README intact (but they can freely edit the script), OR delete the repository (NiceATC/pp-AMMBR) and the file (NiceATC/pp-AMMBR/blob/master/teste02.js).

There must be signs the project was originally CREATED and LICENSED by me, and EDITED/MODIFIED by them.

**Do you have the alleged infringer's contact information? If so, please provide it:**  
I do not.

**Type (or copy and paste) the following statement: "I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration."**  
I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

**Type (or copy and paste) the following statement: "I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed."**  
I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
