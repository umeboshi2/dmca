My name is [private], and I am the [private] of More Mountains, the copyright owner of the Infinite Runner Engine. I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

I’m the [private] of the Infinite Runner Engine, an asset on sale exclusively on Unity’s Asset Store : https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/51328

I have a good faith belief that the following repositories/folders :

https://github.com/SergioMadrigal/runner   
[removed by owner]

offer publicly the contents (code, sounds, visual assets…) of my asset, and that content shouldn't be published anywhere, as it violates Asset Store Terms of Service and EULA (http://unity3d.com/ru/legal/as_terms), APPENDIX 1, sections 5 & 9 and my own copyrights. I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

I have created issues in these repositories, or tried contacting their author, but haven’t received any response. Please remove these repositories or turn them private, so that the proprietor of this site discontinues its criminal activities.

Thank you,
