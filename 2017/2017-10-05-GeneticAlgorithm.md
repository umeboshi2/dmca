"I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice."

**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**  
yes

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**  
my original is right here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMeT2k1ytYs&t=871s I later uploaded ths to github so my github upload is actually newer than his (making it look like I copied him) but that is not the case and you can see that from this video. The guy that copied my code also made a youtube video the same as mine and I have had this removed from youtube.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository's URL:**   

https://github.com/Alok-Bishoyi/GeneticAlgorithm-Python

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  

I'm unsure of how to do this, sorry

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**  
Again I am unsure of this, I haven't studied licensing

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**   
No, the code is a pure copy so removal would be required

**Do you have the alleged infringer's contact information? If so, please provide it:**  

no

**Type (or copy and paste) the following statement: "I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration."**
