Dear Github-Team,  
  
I am working for the TU Darmstadt at the department of [private]. As part of our educational program we provide solutions for our exercises. Students are allowed to take photos of these or write down the way of solving the excersises. They are not allowed to upload photos of our exercise solutions somewhere openly accessible on the internet (for different reasons/some for legal reasons in Germany).  
They are of course allowed to upload thern own handwritten solutions.  
  
Therefor we ask you to remove the following repository:  
https://github.com/kmaus083/Kraftfahrzeugtechnik_Uebungen_Loesungen  
as these are photographys from our "Kraftfahrzeugtechnik"-lecture (English: automotive lecture) solution materials. We didn't grantt any student (which we cannot identify, as the username does directly state who it is) to upload these solutions and we inform our students (and of course deparment members as well), that the distribution of these documents openly accesible on the web is permitted.  
  
I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration."  
  
Further on:  
I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed."  
  
I also cofirm that I have read your "Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice".
