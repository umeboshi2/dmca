It seems that he clones all the files under my repository without my permission and he gets 10 stars which is something I care about a lot. He only changes the name of the branch. He even keeps my academic paper with my name on it in his repository.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository's URL:**  
The whole repository should be taken down:  
https://github.com/yuanzhaoYZ/Barra-Multiple-factor-risk-model

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  
I haven't got any fork from this guy. I think he simply downloads all the files from my depository and then uploaded them again without any changes.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**  
I think the license should be open sourced. But previously I didn't assign any license to this work because I didn't notice this option. And just now I put an MIT license to it.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**  
No, he has to remove it.

**Do you have the alleged infringer's contact information? If so, please provide it:**  
My own contact information is via email at [private]
