The following repository contains a User Interface template kit for Microsoft’s Xamarin.Forms platform:  
https://github.com/closetoyou293/OpenUIKit

It’s a “clean” fork from another repository (it doesn’t contain original commits):  
https://github.com/infoAppDev/OpenUIKit

We’ve already submitted a DMCA takedown notice for the original repository that was actioned by Github and the owners cleared that repository. Github also took down the 10 original forks. This fork happened between I sent the original notice and the action was taken by Github. Here is the original notice:  
https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2018/2018-06-18-UXDivers.md

I’m including the information about the infringement material again using the URLs of this new fork below.

The file names of the Screens and their categories (the folders), as well as the full visual design has been copied from our product Grial UIKit. Grial UIKit is also a User Interface template kit for Xamarin.Forms platform. You can see Grial UIKit screenshots, screen names and categories here:

For instance:

You can see they even kept Leonardo DiCaprio image

These are just a few examples but all the screens they provide are a copy of a screen we provide. They’ve changed the colors and usually (but not always) the application data (images and texts).

Running the code in that repo results in an application that is a clone of our sample app from a navigational standpoint (and of course, the pages are the same). Here are our iOS and Android published sample apps:
