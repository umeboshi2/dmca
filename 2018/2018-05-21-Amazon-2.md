Dear Github,

I have read and understood Github's guide to filing a DMCA notice. I am writing to request that the following site be removed from Github:

https://github.com/prakashr85/myScripts/blob/df36d17cacaeeda5747e55734716a6e0ec5aeace/get_tc_testrail.py

This site contains Amazon code, and the code is proprietary to Amazon.com. The code contained in this site relates to a service on Amazon. The entirety of the site should be removed for containing Amazon code.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web page is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

I swear under penalty of perjury that the information above is correct and that I am authorized to act for the copyright owner.

Thank you for reviewing this request.
