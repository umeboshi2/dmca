Thank you for your help and I'm sorry reply late.
I have prepared DMCA Takedown.

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

The source code for this path following:
https://github.com/metromancn/TestMM/tree/master/TestTransit/

[3]
* these source codes use the package name "jp.co.yahoo.xxx" and Y!J
use the package name. For example,
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.co.yahoo.android.apps.transit
(value of "id" is a package name)

* This user's app is similar to Y!J transit app.
Metroman
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xinlukou.metroman
Yahoo! transit (previous design)
http://transit.loco.yahoo.co.jp/smartphone/app/

* There are many characteristic name files for that (a.java, b.java,
...). It seems that Y!J transit app has been reverse enginnering.
https://github.com/metromancn/TestMM/tree/master/TestTransit/src/jp/co/yahoo/android/ads

Y!J forbids reverse enginnering.

Remove this repository completely to prevent that YJ in-house source
code is viewable from commit history.
