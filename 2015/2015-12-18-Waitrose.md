My name is [private] from Waitrose and on behalf of the copyright
owner Waitrose, I am sending a DMCA takedown notice to your website with
regard to the following infringing URL:

https://github.com/ianouk12/bps

The whole directory BPS contains all the sourcecode of our (Waitrose)
Branch Picking System. In the wrong hands this could be devastating to our
company so we need this code removed asap.

This letter is official notification under the provisions of Section 512(c)
of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") to effect removal of the
above-reported infringements. I request that you immediately issue a
cancellation message as specified in RFC 1036 for the specified postings
and prevent the infringer, who is identified by its web address, from
posting the infringing content to your servers in future. Please be advised
that the law requires you, as a service provider, to "expeditiously remove
or disable access to" the infringing content upon receipt of this notice.
Non-compliance may result in a loss of immunity for liability under the
DMCA.

I have good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained
of here is not authorized by me, the copyright holder, or the law. I swear
that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of
perjury, that I am the copyright owner or am authorized to act on behalf of
the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Please send me a prompt response indicating the actions you have taken to
resolve this matter as soon as possible.

Sincerely,

[private]
