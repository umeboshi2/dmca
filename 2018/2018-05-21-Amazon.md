Dear Github,

I have read and understood Github's guide to filing a DMCA notice. I am writing to request that the following sites be removed from Github:

https://github.com/C2Tao/thefoursteps/blob/master/utils.py  
https://github.com/zjb421/ATVBlaster/blob/master/BlasterReporter.java  
https://github.com/zjb421/WebLab/blob/master/weblab.html  

These sites contain Amazon code, and the code is proprietary to Amazon.com. The code contained in these sites relate to different services on Amazon. The entirety of the sites should be removed for containing Amazon code.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

I swear under penalty of perjury that the information above is correct and that I am authorized to act for the copyright owner.

Thank you for reviewing this request.
