Hello all,

As per your webpage.

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice

1. I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

2. I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

I have attempted to contact the user via email and attempted to reach out to the user from other posters that have known him on the site and while he was with our company.

Unfortunately all of those produced negative results in contacting this user.

As my final resort I am reaching out to Github.com to remove this data.

The following links are the data and code related to and owned by Credit Suisse. we are asking to be removed as they link to our company and contain code that we fear could be collected and manipulated along with other data and scripts to circumvent and possibly infiltrate our networks.
