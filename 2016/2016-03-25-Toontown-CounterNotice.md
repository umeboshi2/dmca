I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Counter Notice.https://github.com/malverde/Toontown-World-Online-Leak

[private]

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.

The content linked up above is of my own with a few edits made to it they stole the work from me originally and have modified it and under the fair use act I believe that work i have done my self which has then been taken and then edited is still my rightful work and in this case this copyright claim is invalid

The only legal copyright claim that can be made against this work is Disney Inc. As this branches off of their own stuff not off the cliamant

I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.
