**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf?**  
I am the copyright owner.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**  
I am making and selling Anticheat and Admintools for a game, it is distributed through my website, here is my imprint:  
https://infistar.de/eng/imprint

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL:**  
This entire repository is a reversed engineered illegal copy of my property!   
https://github.com/Flawww/infistar_threads

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  
I did not search for that, why would I have to search for illegal uploads of my goods - isn't it your job to control what people upload here?

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**  
No, it is not open source. It is forbidden to share my software with anybody. Especially to reverse engineer it!

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**  
It needs to be all removed and the person who uploaded it needs to be blocked / banned or he will do it again. He is part of a team that is selling cracked software and game-hacks. They call themselves "Cyber Terrorists" ..

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it:**  
no I don't have that. He's probably from [private] - I am from [private]. This is hit GitHub tho:

Why would I put even more time into this? guys it is getting frustrating. Emails did not help and this here is just getting too much. It is my property and you are hosting that. I have absolutely no problem with getting lawyers involved at this point... Remove it asap. It costs me money and customers!
