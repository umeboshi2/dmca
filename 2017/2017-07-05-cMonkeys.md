**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**  

Yes.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**  

I'm the creator of a commercially licensed (i.e. not free in any sense of the word) Unity plugin called cInput.

Information about cMonkeys here: http://cmonkeys.com/about/

You can see cInput on our website here: http://cmonkeys.com/cinput/  
And it is listed for sale on the Unity Asset Store here: https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/3129  
And also on itch.io here: https://cmonkeys.itch.io/cinput2  

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository's URL:**

The following directories, including all files and subdirectories contained within them:  
https://github.com/xKriostar/WorkPlace/tree/master/Assets/cMonkeys  
https://github.com/xKriostar/WorkPlace/tree/master/Assets/Plugins/cMonkeys  
https://github.com/Acrylami/project-gamgam/tree/master/Assets/cMonkeys

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

cInput is licensed only under a proprietary license. See the comment at the top of cInput.cs in one of the infringing repositories:  
https://github.com/Acrylami/project-gamgam/blob/master/Assets/cMonkeys/cInput/Plugins/cInput.cs

"cInput [...] by cMonkeys

"This script is NOT free, unlike Custom Inputmanager 1.x. Therefore the use of this script is strictly personal and may not be spread without permission."

And a similar message can be found on the first page of the cInput Reference Manual.pdf (online version of which can be found here: https://cmonkeys.gitbooks.io/cinput-reference-manual/

"cInput 2 is a commercial release and is not free."

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**

If they don't want to remove the entire repository, the owner of the repo would need to either set the repo to private or remove the infringing files from their repo and revise the history so that it the files cannot be accessed in any way from the public GitHub repos or from (future) forks of their repos.

**Do you have the alleged infringer's contact information? If so, please provide it:**

I do not, other than the usernames associated with the repositories which contain the infringing material. I attempted to contact the infringers via the Issues system nearly a year ago but never received a response. See the following issues for further information:
