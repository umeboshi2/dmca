Dear Sir/Madam:

RE: GITHUB.COM/NOTNIRO/KIK8

Our firm represents Kik Interactive Inc. (“Kik”) in connection with intellectual property matters. We write regarding content located on the website GITHUB.COM.
Our client created and owns the rights in the KIK MESSENGER mobile application that provides users with real-time instant messaging software related services.  You can view examples of Kik’s mobile app on their website at KIK.COM.  You can also download the app on various app stores, such as at: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=kik.android&hl=en.   
It has recently come to our attention that “notniro”, a user on the GITHUB.COM website, has without authorization, copied Kik’s mobile application.  Details are indicated below:

1.	Identification of copyrighted work
a.	Copyrighted work: KIK MESSENGER
b.	Copyright owner: Kik Interactive Inc.
2.	Copyright infringing material or activity found at: https://github.com/notniro/kik8 -All of the files in the repository located at https://github.com/notniro/kik8 infringe our client’s copyright.

It appears to be that the infringer has decompiled Kik’s Android installation package, has minimally modified portions of Kik’s code and has produced derivative copies of the Kik mobile

app, and is offering these copies at the link above, without authorization of the copyright owner and in violation of Kik’s End User License Agreement.
The making available of Kik’s proprietary and copyright material without authorization amounts to copyright infringement in violation of Federal statutes.
Please remove this content immediately and desist in any further infringement.  If this is not done immediately we will escalate this enforcement and pursue additional legal steps available to us, which may include criminal prosecution and civil remedies.
I have a good faith belief that use of the material that appears on the service is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or by operation of law.  The information in this notice is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that I am authorized to act on behalf of an owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
This letter is written without prejudice to any other rights or remedies of Kik, all of which are expressly reserved.
You may contact us to discuss this matter further as needed.  Our contact particulars are:

We look forward to receiving your prompt response.
Yours truly,
