Hello

I am contacting to request a DMCA takedown of the following repo:  
https://github.com/case451/newman-master.

This repo is a copy of private code. It was posted without permission. It
contains API keys among other sensitive materials not intended for public
consumption.

It contains no original work; resolution is deleting the repo from Github.

I can be contacted at [private].

Appirio Corporation attn: [private]  
201 S. Capitol Ave  
Suite 1100  
Indianapolis, IN 46225

We have attempted to contact the user at his registered github email
address but that email bounced; we found another address online and have
contacted them there: [private]

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described
above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner,
or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this
notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am
authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is
allegedly infringed.

​
Thanks,

[private]
