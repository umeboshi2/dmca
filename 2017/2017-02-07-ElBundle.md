**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  
Removed in the previous request.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

The license strictly states that "if you remix, transform, or build upon the material, you may not distribute the modified material.". My material is also being exploited for commercial profit by the software used to run the code in this repository, which is also strictly forbidden.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**  
This the the second infringement this author has made against my copyright. Due to the severity of this infringement, I ask that GitHub disable access to the content provided in the repository.

**Do you have the alleged infringer's contact information? If so, please provide it:**  
No.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
