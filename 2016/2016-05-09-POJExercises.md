DMCA takedown notice

To Whom It May Concern:

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

I've noticed that a repository on GitHub had made some copies of my published work without authorization. It seems that the user XiaochenCui is related to the copyright infringement.

The original repository is located at https://github.com/TianyiChen/Exercises/ . It continuously reserves all rights. As a result, reproducing any part of this repository directly leads to copyright infringement.

The file https://github.com/XiaochenCui/POJ-exercises/blob/master/1002_487-3279.cpp is an illegal duplicate of https://github.com/TianyiChen/Exercises/blob/master/POJ/1002.cpp

The file https://github.com/XiaochenCui/POJ-exercises/blob/master/README.md is an illegal duplicate of https://github.com/TianyiChen/Exercises/blob/1ae96ec59cb3bfc12f12258a6cde6deab0f4bd49/README.md

I request GitHub, as the service provider, to take expeditious action to delete or disable access to the material described above.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Yours truthfully,  
[private]
