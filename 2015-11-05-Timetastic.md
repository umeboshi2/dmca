Dear Sirs,

Firstly, we have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

We shall follow your recommended complaint structure:

2. The copyrighted material that has been infringed is our Website and Web Application “Timetastic” located here https://timetastic.co.uk and behind our signup process here https://app.timetastic.co.uk (we can provide login credential for your evaluation is necessary but the screen shots and illustrations used through out our website maybe sufficient).

3. We can see the design infringements on their promotional website here http://timeoff.management which is hosted on github here: https://github.com/vpp/timeoff-management 

  We believe the level of infringement to be such that the entire repository would consist of an infringement.

  The first thing we noticed was the website copy -

  A single specific example would be this:

  From Time off Manager:
  "Manager says Yes or No
  Department bosses receive an email with the request. They just click to approve or decline."

  V’s this from Timetastic:

  "Boss Says Yes or No
  Department bosses receive an email with the request. They just click to approve or decline. No more waiting around for a decision."

  But then we also noticed the screen shots were a replication of our application too:

  The main UI structure and navigation.  
  The modal windows  
  The database designs  

  We also noted their comment on our design here, and their desire to "have something like this" https://github.com/vpp/timeoff-management/search?utf8=✓&q=timetastic 

4. In order to remedy the infringement we believe the user would need to redesign their user interface, redesign their navigation and app structure, redesign their database structure, change their website. Effectively delete their entire work and start from scratch.

5. Our address and contact details: Timetastic Limited, [private] or [private]. Phone: [private].

6. The infringe can be found here https://github.com/vpp here https://twitter.com/FreeTimeOffApp here [private]

7. I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

8. I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

9. Signed: [private] - [private].
