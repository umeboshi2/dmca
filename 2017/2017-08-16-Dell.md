DMCA Agent,

I am a [Private] at Dell Inc ("Dell"). It has recently come to my attention that some Dell confidential and proprietary materials have been posted onto GitHub here: https://github.com/paromita8888/Dell.TestDrive. 

I performed an internal investigation and determined the person that posted these materials was previously employed by Dell, had access to these materials, and copied/distributed these confidential and proprietary materials to GitHub without permission.

As such, I have a good faith belief that use of all the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner (Dell), or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration. Based on information provided to me from the internal team that manages this material, it is my belief that this notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, I contend that I am authorized to act on behalf of Dell whom materials are being infringed.

Accordingly, I respectfully request that all this infringing content/materials be removed from the github website (https://github.com/paromita8888/Dell.TestDrive). If you have any questions, I could be contacted at [Private], or via my office phone at [Private].

Sincerely,

[Private] (please consider this my electronic signature)
