Dear Github DMCA Agent,

we are the new owner of the galleria framework (https://galleria.io) and
bought all rights on the software form the previous owner aino who didn't
seem to enforce their copyright.

The main framework is free and under MIT, but there are also premium themes
(https://galleria.io/downloads) which are under copyright and not allowed
to be distributed by hosting them in public repositories. You may find the
original license file here: https://galleria.io/license/license-2011/

*What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if
the entire repository, the repository's URL:*
