Gentlemen:

I am the Managing Director, Information Technology, EIS Group, [PRIVATE].

Today we identified a significant violation of our intellectual property policy which has resulted in the posting of certain of our proprietary information on GitHub.  

We request that you remove this material from GitHub. Please consider this our takedown notice under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA").   

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

We have discovered a publically available Github site with non-published proprietary EIS Group code openly available at the following address: 

https://github.com/IdeaUJetBrains/Bug144050/commit/a1baade018503acadccc25132cb1594073211c16

We have tracked from the public info on the site to an email address which is [PRIVATE] at https://api.github.com/users/IdeaUJetBrains/events/public

This led us to [PRIVATE] and  [PRIVATE]

Apparently, one of our developers, [PRIVATE] [PRIVATE] opened up a bug with Idean on Aug 18th https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-144050 referring to our code. 

A contributor from Idean ([PRIVATE]) eventually responded and may have accidently posted some EIS proprietary code. 

That is apparently what started the chain of events.  

EIS Group requests that you take down the Github area that contains the EIS code.


The contact information for this notice is [PRIVATE], [PRIVATE], mobile number [PRIVATE], Managing Director, Information Technology, EIS Group, [PRIVATE].


Use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, which is EIS Group, or its agent, or the law.


I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.  

Very truly yours,

[Private]
