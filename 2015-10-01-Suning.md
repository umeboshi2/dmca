To Github,
I am the copyright owner of the source code being infringed at:

I would like to remove and disable the above repositories due to infringement of
our codebase. I have since reviewed and investigated a substantial amount of
forked repos (example listed below). All the forked repos are infringing to the
same extent as the parent repository. I would like to remove and disable all the
forked repositories as well.
