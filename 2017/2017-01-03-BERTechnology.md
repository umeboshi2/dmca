Dear Github DMCA Agent:  
We recently noticed that a GitHub user called “ConlyWork” have posted some source codes which are infringing the rights of the original copyright owner: Beijing BER Technology Company Ltd...  
I’m authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf. Those codes were commercial source codes which belong to the copyright owner.
Please remove all of the following infringing files:  
conlywork.github.io：https://github.com/conlywork/conlywork.github.io  
ConlyWorkspace：https://github.com/conlywork/ConlyWorkspace  
 
Those source codes are not licensed under any open source license. We don’t have any contact information about this “ConlyWork” yet, and we hope you can provide to us if you do.  
 
I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.  
I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.  
I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.  
 
We appreciate your assistance to help us to remove all the infringing codes of ConlyWork, thank you!
