Github Inc,

Earlier this year we locally cloned one of our private repositories and then published it back to the Github site.
This was likely done in the old version of the desktop client, and caused the cloned repository to be become
publicly visible i.e. it was no longer treated as a private repository.

As soon as this oversight was identified the status of the repository was changed to private, and the
necessary code changes were made.

However, during it's public period the repository was cloned by another Github user, and so remains in the
public domain under their account.

To be clear, it was never our intention for this repository to be made publicly available, and the code that it
contains is not covered by any open source licences i.e. it remains covered by the usual copyright provisions.
It is not our belief that the user concerned had any ill intent, but we have not been able to reliably identify him
in order to ask that he remove the repository from public view. We acknowledge that he likely has a local copy
of the code, but our specific concern here is the published version on the Github site.

We are therefore formally requesting that you remove the unauthorised fork of this repository under your
DMCA Takedown Policy.

The originating repository can be found here (not to be removed):

https://github.com/notreadbyhumans/toog

The forked copy can be found here (to be removed):

https://github.com/jameswfoster/toog

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is
not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright
owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

To reÂ­iterate, the user concerned has not done anything wrong, and we do not wish any action to be taken
against him, but simply want our legacy code removed from the public domain.

If you need any additional information please do not hesitate to contact me.

Yours sincerely,
