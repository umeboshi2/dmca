Hello,  
While browsing the public GitHub today June 14, 2016, the eBay Application Security team became aware of a GitHub account containing over 180 mb of sensitive data including personal private information, trade secrets, and copyright-protected material. The GitHub username associated with the infringing content is xinyuechuanqi .
There are two directories by this user that are all sensitive eBay information:

* https://github.com/xinyuechuanqi/backup

* https://github.com/xinyuechuanqi/script

These contain over 180 mb of internal application source code, usernames &passwords (application accounts, LDAP accounts, and more), configuration files, and certificates. Given the sensitive nature of this exposed data and the volume, eBay requests that GitHub delete this data as soon as possible.

It is my good faith belief that all of the data in these directories infringes our copyright and/or is sensitive information because it reveals personal private information or eBay's trade secrets.  
I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. My contact information is below.

Please respond to this email as soon as possible to confirm that GitHub received this and is acting to take down this data.
Thank you,
