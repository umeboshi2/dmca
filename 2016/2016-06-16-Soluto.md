To whom it may concern,

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

Upon looking at the below link, the user, Kamroot, violated Asurion company policy by uploading copyright code. The Soluto application is owned by Asurion and therefore the whole Soluto folder contains private source code files belonging to Asurion. We are requesting for this folder to be removed for the site. This is proprietary company information that is in direction violation of Asurion corporate policy.

The file can be found at: https://github.com/kamroot/soluto/tree/master/soluto

When accessing the link, the information shared clearly shows that the file is Asurion-specific and contains code from our Soluto application.
