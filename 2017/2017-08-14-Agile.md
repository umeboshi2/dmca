[private] "Agile Product Management with Scrum" is offered for free as a PDF on GitHub thereby infringing my copyright and Pearson Education's publication rights:

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

No, I have not searched for further forks, and I find it difficult to understand why I should be responsible for finding more instances where [private] is provided on GitHub thereby infringing my copyright and Pearson Education's publication rights.
