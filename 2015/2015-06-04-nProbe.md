Dear github,
I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. I am the author, copyright and trademark holder of nProbe whose source code has been published at https://github.com/kvitaly2005/lprobe <https://github.com/kvitaly2005/lprobe> without my permission and against the license and EULA. The user has taken all the nprobe code and put it on github changing its name from nProbe to probe (probably to hide himself). The entire repository is then infringing on my copyright.

I have contacted the repository owner [private] asking to remove the whole repository. He said will contact FSF and let me know.

You can contact me at [private]

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

[private]
