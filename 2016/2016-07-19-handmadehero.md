I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

In the following GitHub repository:

https://github.com/Barret5Ocal/Handmade_Fighter

there exists directories

https://github.com/Barret5Ocal/Handmade_Fighter/tree/master/data/test  
https://github.com/Barret5Ocal/Handmade_Fighter/tree/master/data/test2  
https://github.com/Barret5Ocal/Handmade_Fighter/tree/master/data/test3  

which include, verbatim, the copyrighted art assets from the
commercial download of:

https://handmadehero.org

In order to remedy this, the user (Barret5Ocal) must either

A) delete the entire set of directories, as they contain nothing but our
copyrighted assets, or

B) make this a private repository so it cannot be accessed by the public.

I am unable to contact the user directly as they do not list an e-mail
address on their GitHub profile page.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials
described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the
copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this
notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am
authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that
is allegedly infringed.
