Hello,

"I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice." It has been reported to Beyond Yoga and their Digital Agency "Retail Reinvented" that the source code of the Beyond Yoga development site has been published on Github containing proprietary and confidential information, including account credentials, system paths and other data that may post a security risk to customers on beyondyoga.com. The specific GitHub repositories are are entirely subject to removal:

#1 https://github.com/ipluswave/magento_ecommerce_project

#2 [repository already removed by user]

In addition the following fork should be removed as it also is infringing on the copyrighted and proprietary work extending from Repo #2 above. 

Fork #1 https://github.com/ibndooom/magento_2016_7

To remedy the infringement, the Users should remove and delete the proprietary work entirely from GitHub.

I sent an email to the GitHub account user on May 18, 2017 with no reply. Your assistance in facilitating a remedy to this breach would be very much appreciated. Please contact me directly anytime
