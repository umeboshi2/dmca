Dear GitHub Agents,

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

In a regular scan on my copyrighted files, using Pixsy.com it came to my attention that one of your users is in violation of my inherent copyright by using an image as a profile image. This image is commercial works and is online for sale. In no way has it been expressed, written or allowed to be used freely in whatever sense, with or without permission from the artist (myself).

I was never contacted by this member requesting to use it, which he also did on Google+ (with has now been removed.)

This is a link that identifies the user and the profile image of my works: https://github.com/mato75
The image is of a caricature of Jack Nicholson. You can see the original item on my site here: [redacted]

The infringement is the simple use of my commercial image as a profile image, without permission or sale. You can see it clearly here: https://github.com/mato75

The best remmed would be that the user removes the offending item, and is notified that if he uses my work again, then the procedure will move to the next stage.

I am not aware of the infringers location or contact details.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
