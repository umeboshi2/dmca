**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

My book is available here for free: https://leanpub.com/hitchhikers_ggplot2  
The ISBN is ISBN-13: 978-956-362-693-3

The alleged repositories below are old drafts of my book with lots of code that doesn't work today and means that I'm getting emails about "code not working" from people who obtain the unofficial version.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository's URL:**

[repository already removed]

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

These are the additional forks I found:  
1. https://github.com/hamzamohdzubair/hitchhikers_ggplot2  
2. https://github.com/loiyumba/hitchhikers_ggplot2  
3. https://github.com/mmatusg/hitchhikers_ggplot2  
4. https://github.com/motlesneh/hitchhikers_ggplot2  
5. https://github.com/MSBICOE/hitchhikers_ggplot2  

each one of these contain no newer material and are just copies of an old draft from my book.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No. It's "available for free material", but still copyrighted.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**

Please remove this. The book can be obtained for free and with updated. I'm tired of annoying emails about "why this doesn't work?" / "your code is outdated" / etc.

**Do you have the alleged infringer's contact information? If so, please provide it:**

Yes. I wrote to the users that show contact information and I haven't received replies.
