Hi Github Team,
 
 
I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.
 
The Repository 

https://github.com/doomoon/copycat 

by user ‘pipinet’ 

(https://github.com/pipinet) 

used decompiled code of our commercial server software “HiveMQ” (http://www.hivemq.com), owned by dc-square GmbH (http://www.dc-square.de)
 
 
There is evidence that the code was stolen from HiveMQ:
 
 
- https://github.com/doomoon/copycat/blob/aa7ae140ab641a1ca8b4a073829f05e4fdd25eb6/copycat-broker/src/main/java/com/doomoon/copycat/topic/sys/builtin/SubscriptionCount.java#L18
 
 
The exaxt same repository by the user 'pipinet' was already taken down in June (see https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2015-06-08-HiveMQ.md) and the user continued to publish stolen code.
 
 
The complete repository, all files, all content, all lines of code, and all mentions of HiveMQ must be deleted immediately both on Github and locally, or we will take legal action against this individual and all parties involved.
