Hi,
I am a [private] at Dachuwang Technologies, Inc.

I have read and understand GitHub’s Guide to Filing a DMCA notice.

Some git repos created by GitHub user “lpreterite” on github.com that contain proprietary information of which we own the exclusive copyrights to.

The unauthorized material is contained in the following repo:
https://github.com/lpreterite/dachuwang

The offending information is specifically contained in the following subfolders within the “dachuwang” repo:  
• service  
• sql  
• web  
• README.md  

This letter is official notification under Section 512(c) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (”DMCA”), and I seek the removal of the aforementioned infringing material from GitHub. I request that you immediately notify the infringer of this notice and inform them of their duty to remove the infringing material immediately, and notify them to cease any further posting of infringing material related to dachuwang Technologies to GitHub in the future.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Should you wish to discuss this with me please contact me directly. Thank you.
