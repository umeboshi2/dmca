Hi Github

1. I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

2. The infringed repo

https://github.com/duemunk/Async <https://github.com/duemunk/Async>

2. Repo that infringes
https://github.com/khoiln/RunKit <https://github.com/khoiln/RunKit>
The repo is clearly a copy of Async where function names and parameters have been changed. Comparing Async.swift <https://github.com/duemunk/Async/blob/master/Source/Async.swift> to RunKit.swift <https://github.com/khoiln/RunKit/blob/master/Source/RunKit.swift> show this very clearly. The entire code structure and functionality is similar. Other parts of the repo also infringes such as code examples in the readme and the unit tests.

The following forks similarly infringes:
