To whom it may concern,   

I am writing on behalf of ABC iview regarding the tool created available in GitHub, Python-iview.  

https://github.com/vadmium/python-iview  

The ABC owns or controls copyright in television program content communicated via ABC iview, which is accessible on the website and authorised third party platforms and devices.  

It is a breach of the copyright in the iview television program content to copy or store this content without permission. Any party who authorises such a breach of copyright would also be in breach of the Copyright Act. It is also a breach of the ABC iview Terms of Use to adjust or circumvent digital rights management security and technical protection measures used by ABC iview to protect the content from unauthorised access.  

We need to take steps to ensure the content is used within the rights we acquire and, at present, the rights that we acquire do not allow for distribution of iview content outside of ABC-approved services. The risk of not ensuring the content is used within these rights is that the content canâ€™t be shown on iview at all.  

I am sure you would appreciate that the ABC considers it important to protect its intellectual property and the rights of its content licensors.  

I have contacted the name of the developer associated with the listing in GitHub ([private]), as you can see below, and he has informed me that the link is actually a community maintained version that he has no control over. He indicates he ceased distribution of Python-iview back in 2012 when he received a takedown notice from ABC at the time. In the circumstances, we ask that you withdraw the entire Python-iview tool from GitHub as your provision of this tool contravenes the Copyright Act and ABC iview program content Terms of Use.

We would appreciate it if you could comply with this request within one week of the date of this email. We hope that this matter can be resolved amicably and without unnecessary formality.  

The ABC reserves its rights.  

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorised to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
