Hi Github Support,

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Counter Notice.

These files are the ones I want to challenge:

https://github.com/wicker/Skies-of-Dinotopia/blob/master/galleria/themes/classic/galleria.twelve.css  
https://github.com/wicker/Skies-of-Dinotopia/blob/master/galleria/themes/classic/galleria.twelve.min.js

I paid $29 for the license to use the Galleria theme Twelve on Jan 6, 2012.
The license was a lifetime license. I have evidence of the
initial receipt and evidence of a further email sent 10/25/2016 from
Galleria that
explicitly indicates the license is a lifetime license.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the
material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or
misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.

I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial
district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise
the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will
accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA
notification or an agent of such person.

Please redact the following three lines with my personal and contact
information:

My name is [private]. My name was legally changed in summer 2012. My
email addresses are [private] and [private].

I recently changed my contact email for Github from [private] to
[private].

My phone number is [private] and my address is [private].

Signed,
[private]
