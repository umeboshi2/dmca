**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

This was a set of plex control scripts I wrote and previously shared on github here: https://github.com/amazingr4b/TBN-Plex

Some time ago I removed the original files and revoked the general use license. This person found some remnant of an old fork and has copied my old files as if they were their own.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository's URL:**

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

https://github.com/LTAcosta/TBN-Plex should also be removed.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**

**Do you have the alleged infringer's contact information? If so, please provide it:**
