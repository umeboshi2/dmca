To whom it may concern,

I have read and understand GitHubâ€™s Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

My name is [Private], I am the [Private] of UgMO Technologies and am writing in response to the companies proprietary information being shared in a public repository by a former software contractor. We wish to have the repository removed from public view. The contributor has been contacted and refuses to remove the information which is the property of UgMO Technologies. The information was unlawfully copied from the companies data base and is now being exposed on a public repository. Below is the link to the public repository that contains information all of which is owned by UgMO Technologies. Below the link is additional contact information for the contributor.
