Though it's true that I have read and understand GitHub's "Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice", please note that GitHub cannot condition its compliance with federal law on an extra set of requirements or procedures.

Here comes the complaint!

The infringed works are my copyrighted fonts, Equity and Concourse:

http://equityfont.com  
http://concoursefont.com

Which are found in this repo:

https://github.com/unbalancedparentheses/federicocarrone.com

Within this file:

https://github.com/unbalancedparentheses/federicocarrone.com/blob/master/src/fonts.css

The user 'unbalancedparentheses' is not, according to my records, a licensed user of these fonts (though if he were a licensed user, this kind of use would still be forbidden under the license.) Thus the fonts have been taken illegally & are being used illegally.

I attempted to contact the user by posting an issue to this repo on Feb 17, and a followup on March 2:

https://github.com/unbalancedparentheses/federicocarrone.com/issues/11

There was no response. The user has been active on GitHub during that time:

https://github.com/unbalancedparentheses?tab=activity

So he is just ignoring me.

Thus, I have a good-faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner.
