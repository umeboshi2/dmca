4. Description of copyright infringement  
The publisher's repository- with the use of an identical unauthorized virtual cat character as well as every other visual part contained in the repository folder- causes average customers to believe that such content is authorized by Outfit7 Limited.  
Regarding the fact that Outfit7 Limited has more than 2,8 billion downloads worldwide and more than 230 million monthly active users, and that marketing for Talking Tom mobile app was mostly conducted with internal marketing, it is safe to say that most users connect Talking Tom mobile application with Outfit7 Limited.  
The app was first published on iTunes, on June 26th 2010 and entered Google Play on November 3rd 2011.  

5. Statements  
I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.  
I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.  
I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.  
I confirm that I have investigated each individual case and that my sworn statements apply to each identified fork.
