Attn: Copyright Agent, GitHub, Inc.

Pursuant to 17 USC 512(c)(3)(A), this communication serves as a
statement that:

I am the copyright owner of a commercial Unity asset called Isometric
Toolkit <https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#%21/content/7047>.
Everything within this directory
<https://github.com/trentmillar/unity-poc/tree/master/Assets/Isometric%20Toolkit>
of the project "trentmillar/unity-poc" is infringing on my copyright.
The license granted to purchasers of Unity assets allows them to use
them commercially, but not redistribute them in source form as this
person has done.

I would appreciate it if the offending content were removed from your site.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials
described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the
copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this
notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am
authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is
allegedly infringed.

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

Thanks,
