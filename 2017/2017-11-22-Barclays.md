Re: GitHub.com DMCA Copyright Infringement Notification  
  
Dear Sir or Madam:  
  
I am [private] of Cyber Operations at Barclays, which is the owner of copyrights in Barclays systems source codes (collectively, the “Protected Works”). It has come to our attention that the website located at GitHub.com (the “Site”) has copied and is displaying certain of the Protected Works without authorization from Barclays. This letter is to serve notice of this infringement pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512.  
  
Pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512, we provide the following information:  
  
1. I am a duly authorized representative of Barclays, the exclusive rights holder of the Protected Works currently being infringed on the Site, a list of which appears on Exhibit A hereto.  
  
2. The infringing material is located at a series of URLs within the Site. See Exhibit A hereto for a complete list of URLs.  
  
3. You may contact Barclays by replying to my email, [private] or by calling me directly at [private].  
  
4. Barclays believes in good faith that the use of the referenced works on the Site is not authorized by Barclays, any of its agents, or the law.  
  
5. The information in this notification is accurate; and, under penalty of perjury, Barclays is the owner of the exclusive rights in the works infringed by the Site.  
  
Barclays therefore demands that you immediately remove the infringing material from the Site, and confirm such removal to the undersigned within five days of the date of this notice. The foregoing is without prejudice to any of Barclays’ rights, remedies and defenses, all of which are expressly reserved.
