Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?

While I certainly also dispute the notice this whole thing just causes pain for no gain. I'll change the product name to something different if that's what it takes. django-fhadmin customizes Django's administration interface and has been done by Feinheit, my company (that's where the fhadmin name comes from). Also, the project has probably been inactive for a longer time than the fhadmin.org domain name is even registered at all...
