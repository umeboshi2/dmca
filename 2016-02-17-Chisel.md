I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

This notice is in regards to the repository Chisel-2/Chisel-3 (
https://github.com/Chisel-2/Chisel-3). 

This project contains multiple
instances of copied code from a GPL repository (
https://github.com/Chisel-Team/Chisel), however it has been placed under a
closed-source license (
https://github.com/Chisel-2/Chisel-3/blob/master/LICENSE).

Here is a full list of the files that are infringing on the aforementioned
project:

Prior to this notice we tried to alert the repository owner to the
violation (https://github.com/Chisel-2/Chisel-3/issues/1) but received no
positive response and the issue was locked.

In that issue we detail some of the above files. For convenience, here are
the diffs of a few selected files that show clearly the copied code, and
how it was altered slightly to hide the fact that it was copied.

Do note that these links will expire in a month's time.

To remedy this infringement, the owner would need to do a "clean room"
rewrite of all the listed files. Alternatively they could change the
license to be GPL compatible.
