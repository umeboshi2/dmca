The developer of the plugin got upset and politely asked for me to remove the plugin. He stated that he was working hourly classified under the "work for hire" section of circ09 listed on the government of the united states copyright notice. Here is the PDF and here is a screenshot of him admitting to working at an hourly rate thus for making him an employee on paid time.
