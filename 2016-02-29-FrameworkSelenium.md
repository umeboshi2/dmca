Dear Madam/Sir,

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

I am owner of the project "framework-selenium".I have created this
project in Googlecode but somehow the project got imported in GIT
server and got associated with the user "*tuladharbinup*".So before
filling DMCA i even tried contacting the user to take down the content
of that project by adding issues in that Repository but i didn't get any
reply back.Here is the link of issue which i created  
"https://github.com/tuladharbinup/framework-selenium/issues/1"

Below is the link of the project which i want to remove.  
https://github.com/tuladharbinup/siddharth-selenium/blob/8abe207d8ecf9fd319cff7228fa39ce0834bece5/DummyProject/src/test/java/util/SendMail.java

I want the entire content of the project "framework-selenium" to be
taken down as soon as possible.

My current home address is:

[private]

Email id : [private]

So I am the owner of the repositories but due to I cannot access my user
in github I would like to remove that public repositories as soon as you
can.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials
described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the
copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this
notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am
authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is
allegedly infringed.

Thank you for your time and attention

Regards,
