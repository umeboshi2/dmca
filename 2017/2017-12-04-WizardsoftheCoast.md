*Re: DMCA Notice: Infringement of Wizards of the Coast LLC’s DUNGEONS
& DRAGONS® Property *

Dear Copyright Agent:

We are counsel for Wizards of the Coast LLC (“Wizards”), owner of the
copyrights and trademarks for the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS® roleplaying game and
related publications. For your reference, Wizards’ D&D site is located at
http://dnd.wizards.com/dungeons-and-dragons. We write concerning
“Astranauta’s” Github repository at the following URL:

https://astranauta.github.io/5etools.html

Wizards' DUNGEONS & DRAGONS (“D&D”) game is a fantasy role-playing game in
which each player is assigned a specific character to play. Before the game
begins, each player creates his or her player character by choosing amongst
different powers or "ability scores,” races, character class (occupation),
an alignment (a moral and ethical outlook), and a number of powers, skills
and feats to enhance the character's basic abilities. All of these details
are the entirely fictional, creative, and copyrighted property of Wizards,
and are found in the D&D core rule books (the MONSTER MANUAL®, PLAYER’S
HANDBOOK® and DUNGEON MASTERS GUIDE®), supplemental rule books and other
copyrighted online and printed publications including *Dungeon* magazine
and *Dragon* magazine.

The Astranauta Github repository is a web-based set of utilities that
incorporates and allows a player to search for every rules element of the 5
th edition (“5e”) of the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game, including details on
classes, backgrounds, feats, races, monsters (“bestiary”), spells and other
detail that are the entirely fictional, creative, and copyrighted property
of Wizards and are culled from the various D&D 5th edition publications,
including a book, *Xanather’s Guide to Everthing,™* that was just published
last Friday.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described
above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner,
or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this
notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am
authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is
allegedly infringed."

I confirm that I have read Github’s Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown
Notice:
https://help.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/
.

We therefore ask that Github remove or disable access to the Github
repository at https://astranauta.github.io/5etools.html.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. This letter does not purport
to be a complete statement of the facts or the law and is without prejudice
to Wizards’ legal and equitable rights, all of which are expressly reserved.

Sincerely yours,
