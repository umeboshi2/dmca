To Whom It May Concern:

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice and submit this letter in compliance therewith. It has recently come to Broadcom Corporation's attention that certain of our confidential and proprietary software code have been posted on your website at the locations listed below. That confidential and proprietary information includes, but is not limited to, directory structures and file names that disclose Broadcom's software related to its Wireless Internet Connectivity for Embedded Devices ("WICED") platform.
