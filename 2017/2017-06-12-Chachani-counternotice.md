Dear,

I am the [private] of Aimtec.IO

I have read and understood GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Counter Notice.

Our content was unjustly taken down (DMCA) by Chachani, Misti y Pichu Pichu SRL, visible here: https://github.com/aimtecio/aimtec.sdk

Chachani, Misti y Pichu Pichu SRL alleges that our content
"party copied" source code from them. However, our code borrows ONLY from https://github.com/LeagueSharp/LeagueSharp.SDK, which is currently licensed under the GNU GPL v2 at the time of this writing. We have published our source code, declared changes which are easily visible by Git and are distributed under GNU GPL v3, a newer, but compatible license.

We admit to not distributing the original license from LeagueSharp.SDK, and are willing to make changes to provide a copy in our repository.

Their license: https://github.com/LeagueSharp/LeagueSharp.SDK/blob/master/LICENSE

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.

I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.

[private]

Respectfully,  
[private]
