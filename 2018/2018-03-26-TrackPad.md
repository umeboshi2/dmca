Hello,

I'm the copyright holder for the Trackpad++ software
(http://trackpad.forbootcamp.org)

Contact phone and email address can be found below (in signature).

Unfortunately, our software got affected by a keygen, openly published
at GitHub (at
https://gist.github.com/grandsilence/64a8996c5e7ae94c2bd3c8c9cbc75ff3).
In addition, multiple license keys for the Trackpad++ software have been
published on the same GitHub page by user 'grandsilence'

GitHub Terms of Service (A.8) are clearly violated, and, more
importantly, an international copyright law. We have given NO permission
to a third party (including GitHub user account 'grandsilence') to
reverse engineer our software and generate/distribute the tools for
assigning the License Keys for our software. Please note that the author
of the keygen himself does clearly state, it is THE KEYGEN, followed
with pirated license keys. May I kindly raise the question, since when
GitHub is openly hosting the keygens and pirated licenses? Thank you in
advance for removing this violation.

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. I
have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described
above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright
owner, or its agent, or the law. I swear, under penalty of perjury, that
the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the
copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an
exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Thank you,
