Dear Github Team

I have submitted lots of material from different sources which are ready to
be used by my students and other people. Many people creates copies of my
material, but a few days ago I received the most weird plagiarism action
ever.

User KuberJain made a pull request to my repo after changing my name to his
without futher modification and/or crediting the source.

My repo is:  
https://github.com/pachamaltese/Regression-Models

Which is copied here:  
https://github.com/KuberJain/Reg-Model

And here:  
https://github.com/KuberJain/Regression-Models

My anger comes from a very basic fact: If you want to use other's material,
crediting the source is a must. If you are sufficiently low and evil like
to copy, at least be nice and try to make it silent, not doing pull request
that puts in evidence you plagiarism.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described
above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner,
or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this
notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am
authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is
allegedly infringed.

Provide your contact information.

Provide contact information, if you know it, for the alleged infringer.
