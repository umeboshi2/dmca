I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice

Location of original work, http://www.adobe.com/products/catalog.html?promoid=KAWQI.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Very truly yours,
