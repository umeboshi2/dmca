Hello,

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

Geonomics Global Games Ltd used to be called Roboreus Ltd. (You can verify this via Companies House in the UK.) One of our copyright documents is on GitHub at the following URL:

https://github.com/zeppsky/SnakeProject/blob/master/Programming_Test_%233.0.7_-_Snaky_Serenades(1).pdf

You can see it's our copyright as it says so at the bottom of the document.

We need the user who posted it to remove this copyright document. (We would prefer that he removed the other code relating to our coding test, but we recognise that we have no power to enforce that.)

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Regards,

[Private]
