I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Counter Notice.

The following repo solely contains the decompiled and deobfuscated code of my ([PRIVATE]) closed-source project 'Extra Utilities'. It was uploaded without my knowledge or permission.

https://github.com/Dennisbonke/ExtraUtilities

Since the code is a straight copy of my work it still credits me as the sole author of this work

https://github.com/Dennisbonke/ExtraUtilities/blob/master/src/main/resources/mcmod.info

In addition, I have noticed that this account has made repos of several other closed source works that you may wish to investigate.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Thanks
