Hi,

First and foremost, I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a
DMCA Notice. The same user that I previously reported and have made a DCMA
complaint against has once again forked another repository of mine and has
purposely removed my name from the licensing.

The original repository is located here:

+ github.com/dude719/UEFI-Bootkit

The forked repository I am referring to, and must be removed resides here:

+ https://github.com/Noahii/UEFI-Bootkit

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described
above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner,
or its agent, or the law.

I demand the above specified fork be removed, and all of the material
contained in the fork must be removed. I would also like this user to be
completely blocked from all of my repositories.

Here is my contact information:

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this
notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am
authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is
allegedly infringed.

Thanks,
