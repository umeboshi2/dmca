Good Afternoon,

I have read and understand GitHubâ€™s Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

The work in question is content held in the following identified pages:
https://github.com/jhandfield99/jhandfield99.github.io/blob/1042874ac57ede738295e96f250dc4e381d59645/BMO/www.bmo.com/main/business/news.html  
https://github.com/team-dragons/dragon-site/blob/f142abdf93631f449267ccb0b6165289502859ef/_dev/_harp.json

The files located at the identified pages contain proprietary information that belongs to BMO Financial Group, and the original poster had no known legal authority to share this information publicly. This information is confidential and proprietary to BMO Financial Group, was posted on GitHub without company authorization, and potentially poses a security and privacy risk to the company.

We request that the user remove the following identified content mentioned above.

Contact information for the users is via GitHub user accounts team-dragons and jhandfield99 (no user contact information / readme is listed).

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Kind Regards,  
[private]
