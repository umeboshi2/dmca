Dear Sir / Madam

I would like to bring to your kind attention that we created a git repo
named "[private]" under our git account "smtbuzz" at
[private] & have been regularly committing the
code to this repository.

Today, we saw some unusual activity in our account that said smtbuzz/
*industree-1* forked from *evrimulgen*/industree. As we haven't
created *industree-1
*repository, so on further analysis we figured that another user
"evrimulgen" has forked our project & created a copy at
https://github.com/evrimulgen/industree. While debugging on the possibility
on how the 2 repositories are linked, we deleted the repository and
re-created it today, but this didn't had any effect on the second
repository in question.

The user has not shared any contact information on his github profile, so I
was not able to contact him directly. We have all rights for this code, so
I request you to please follow up with this user & remove the code from his
repository. I can provide you with any additional information for this, if
required from my end. My contact information is as follows:
