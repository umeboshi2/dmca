To Whom It May Concern,

I am an attorney for S&P Capital IQ and am authorized to submit this notification on its behalf as the rightful copyright owner of the Source Code (defined below) that is at issue in this notification.

Pursuant and subject to Section 512(c)(3) of the Copyright Act, S&P Capital IQ is demanding the removal of its proprietary source code ("Source Code") that has been made available on GitHub at the following location(s) by a former S&P Capital IQ employee ([private]) without S&P Capital IQ's permission:  

(1) https://github.com/sokano/Code-Snippets ; 

(2) https://github.com/sokano/Code-Snippets/tree/master/Moban.  

Representative screenshots of the proprietary Source Code is provided below in my earlier e-mail requesting the same removal.  I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described below and at the above stated GitHub page location(s) is not authorized by S&P Capital IQ (the rightful copyright owner), or its agents, under applicable law.

The Source Code was posted by a former employee ([private]) of ours in the same month he left his employment with S&P Capital IQ without our permission.    It appears that [private] maintains a code repository on GitHub, in which he has included the Source Code.  We do not have current contact information for [private] except to the extent it is available at the following public LinkedIn page:

We demand that you immediately (A) remove the Source Code, in its entirety, from GitHub and (B) provide us with prompt written assurance within three (3) days that GitHub has removed the Source Code in its entirety from the GitHub site.

Please feel free to reach out to me directly to discuss this matter further.

Nothing set forth in this e-mail shall constitute a waiver of any right or remedy S&P Capital IQ may have with respect to the Source Code under law or equity.

Kind regards,
[private]
