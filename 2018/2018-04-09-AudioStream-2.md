**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

I am the copyright owner.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original copyrighted work is a Unity package which I am the [private] of, and am selling on Unity Asset Store - https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/65411

As such, it is not publicly available, but I have found via Github search searching for my name that this public repository - https://github.com/YuiyuD/nhip-dieu - contains the asset. The Github search was able to find it because each and every source file which is part of the asset contains this copyright notice: "// (c) 2016, 2017 [private]. All rights reserved. Redistribution of source code without permission not allowed."
as can be seen e.g. here: https://github.com/YuiyuD/nhip-dieu/blob/master/Assets/AudioStream/Scripts/AudioStreamSupport.cs

The same notice is present in all source files which are part of the asset, i.e. all sources under https://github.com/YuiyuD/nhip-dieu/tree/master/Assets/AudioStream directory.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository's URL:**

All files under the Assets/AudioStream directory should be taken down:  
https://github.com/YuiyuD/nhip-dieu/tree/master/Assets/AudioStream

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

There appear to be no forks currently.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No, the work is licensed under no open source license.  
The work is licensed under Unity Asset Store license - https://unity3d.com/legal/as_terms , plus contains copyright notice '// (c) 2016, 2017 [private]. All rights reserved. Redistribution of source code without permission not allowed.' prohibiting redistribution of source files, such as making them available in public repositories.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**

The best solution would be take down the part of the repository which infringes, as mentioned above - i.e. take down https://github.com/YuiyuD/nhip-dieu/tree/master/Assets/AudioStream

**Do you have the alleged infringer's contact information? If so, please provide it:**

I was unable to find any contact information of the infringer on their github page.

**Type (or copy and paste) the following statement: "I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration."**
