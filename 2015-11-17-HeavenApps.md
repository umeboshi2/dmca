Dear Sir,

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice

My name is Mr. [private] and I am the [private] of Heaven Apps. A source code template that your company hosts is infringing on at least one copyright owned by my company.
The user "bigDofSB <https://github.com/bigDofSB>" submitted my original template without any rights to distribute it on your website: http://www.chupamobile.com/ios-full-games/quiz-app-starter-kit-all-in-one-796 

The unauthorized and infringing copy can be found at: https://github.com/digitalpmg/sports-quiz-app

This letter is official notification under Section 512(c) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (”DMCA”), and I seek the removal of the aforementioned infringing material from your servers. I request that you immediately notify the infringer of this notice and inform them of their duty to remove the infringing material immediately, and notify them to cease any further posting of infringing material to your server in the future.
This user must adhere to the licence agreement, specifically:

- We are licensing it to you for reskin purposes only under your personal or business developer account. We remain the owner of the source code and you may not resell or license the code to others.
- You may not purchase this source code for the sole purpose of reskinning and redistributing to Others.  

I am providing this notice in good faith and with the reasonable belief that rights my company owns are being infringed. Under penalty of perjury I certify that the information contained in the notification is both true and accurate, and I have the authority to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright(s) involved.

Thank you,    
[private]
