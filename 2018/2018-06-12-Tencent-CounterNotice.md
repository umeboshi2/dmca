Hi there,

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Counter Notice.

Identify the content that was disabled and the location where it appeared:  
Content URL(
https://github.com/Jacksgong/Blog/blob/fd6bcba4c3dae29128e79233fec4d1b898964bc0/source/_posts/Workflows-Proxy.md)  
on Repo URL(https://github.com/Jacksgong/Blog)

Provide your contact information:   
email [private],  
name [private],  
telephone number [private]    
physical address [private]    

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the
material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or
misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.

I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial
district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise
the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will
accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA
notification or an agent of such person.
