Hello,

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

The original work is located at: https://github.com/OgarProject/Ogar   
The license for the original work (Apache 2.0 license) is located at: https://github.com/OgarProject/Ogar/blob/master/LICENSE.md 

Infringing materials are as follows:
---

https://github.com/JaraLowell/OgarServ   

Entire repository is a derivative work from the original, and has been relicensed under an incompatible license (GPL version 2, found at https://github.com/JaraLowell/OgarServ/blob/master/LICENSE). To remedy this error, the code can be relicensed the Apache 2.0 license or a compatible license, such as GPL version 3.
In addition, the repository removes my name from the license, which is a violation of the Apache 2.0 license requiring that the original copyright be included.

Forks of the above project that carry the same license incompatibility.
