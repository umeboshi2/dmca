Law enforcement authorities of the Russian Federation accused me of writing malicious code that was in the original repository. The code violates article 187 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation and now I can face imprisonment for up to 6 years. After receiving the notification, I immediately deleted the repository, but despite this, the code continues to spread without my knowledge. The laws of Russia in the IT sphere are much worse thought out than in the US, so the damage caused by this code, continues to aggravate my condition. I ask GitHub to help me, as the author of this repository, in stopping the distribution of this code: I am completely its author, I placed it only in my repository and now I want to minimize the terms that threaten me.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?
