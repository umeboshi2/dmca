I want to take down the following site: dm1056272.github.io (he is using the domain whimtrack.me).  
He is phishing our site www.whimtrack.com  
  
**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**  
I am the copyright owner.  
  
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**  
This pages site is a phishing attempt on http://www.whimtrack.com that is my company site.  
  
**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository's URL:**  
The whole repository is a phishing and extortion attempt that uses your pages platform.  
They are also stealing bandwidth from us.  
  
**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  
I am still trying to search for more with no success.  
  
**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**  
Our site is a simple company site for contact information. The infringing site is performing phishing attacks against us.  
  
**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**  
The best solution for now is to stop hosting his phishing site.  
  
**Do you have the alleged infringer's contact information? If so, please provide it:**  
I wish I had. But it seems like a basic phishing/extortion scheme against our company.  
  
**Type (or copy and paste) the following statement: "I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration."**
