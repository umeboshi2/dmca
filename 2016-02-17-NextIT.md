To whom it may concern,

1. I am the legal representative authorized to act on behalf of Next IT Corporation, the owner of certain intellectual property rights ("IP Owner"); I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice, and I appreciate your enforcement of copyright law and support of the IP Owner's rights in this matter.

2. I have a good faith belief that the content located at: http://vherever.github.io/nextit/ displays a direct, literal copy of IP Owner's proprietary NEXT IT logo on the top left corner of the landing page and in other locations relating to this "nextit" repository (https://github.com/vherever/nextit). This use of the IP Owner's copyrighted logo is not authorized by the IP Owner, or the law, and therefore infringes the IP Owner's rights. Furthermore, use of the name of the IP Owner and its trademarks draws a false association with the IP Owner.

3. Please promptly remove the https://github.com/vherever/nextit repository, any use of the NEXT IT logo, and any reference to Next IT Corporation so that the IP Owner's rights are no longer violated.

4. The infringer is GitHub user vherever.

5. I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Sincerely,

[Private]
