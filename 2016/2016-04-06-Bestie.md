Hi Github:

We found that the code of our iOS App Bestie had leaked to Github by one of our emploee. We need to take down it from Github and delete all of the public copies ASAP.

This is our company website:http://www.camera360.com
The product address at itunes:https://itunes.apple.com/app/id953511734
The original code address is:[private]

The leaked code address is:https://github.com/pinguo-phplixiang/local_test_ios

And the forks:

https://github.com/cherishloveyou/local_test_ios
https://github.com/zjucsxxd/local_test_ios

Please feel free to contact me if there has any problem.

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Best Regards
