efficient plantform,and now I need to be very hopefully anble to get Github's

I create many repositroies called ctu-common ,ctu-console,ctu-common, my email

is [Private] and my account is [Private]. The use named newSue forked my code

The following is Github's URL and Screenshots about my forked Repository:

https://github.com/newSue/ctu-common

https://github.com/newSue/ctu-engine

They contain company's import source code,algorithm and system configuration

information,belong to the company's internal data assets,so I hope Github as soon
