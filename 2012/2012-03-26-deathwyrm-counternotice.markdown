To whom it may concern,

The complainant has provided no copyright registration information or other tangible evidence that the material in question is in fact copyrighted, the allegation of copyright violation is therefore in dispute, and at present unsupported.

The complainant does not hold the copyright to the material in question, is not the designated representative of the copyright holder, and therefore lacks standing to assert that my use of the material is a violation of any of the owner's rights.

I can tell you who actually has ownership over the files in question. There are no less than six people involved in this. I am going to highlight the files listed in the complaint, and then a link to the thread in question where they come from.
