**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**  

I am the copyright owner.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original work is here: https://github.com/kuro68k/kboot/blob/master/xmega_usb_bootloader/xmega_usb_bootloader/bootloader.c

Particularly the "poll_usb()" function, but other parts as well.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository's URL:**

https://github.com/ganzziani/XMEGA-USB_Bootloader/blob/master/Source/usb/usb_xmega.c

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes, I believe this is the only one.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

The code is licenced under the GPLv3, which requires attribution. There is no attribution, in the form of a copyright notice or otherwise. Also, the violating code does not appear to be licenced under the GPLv3 or later, which is also required.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**

Add a suitable copyright notice and GPLv3 or later licence.

**Do you have the alleged infringer's contact information? If so, please provide it:**

I have emailed this person, and opened an issue on the repo. I received one response to my email a few weeks ago but nothing since, even after follow-up emails.
