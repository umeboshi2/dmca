Hello Github：

We are Qianxun Spatial Intelligence Inc.(https://www.qxwz.com/).It is nice to be able to use Github such a professional and efficient platform, and now we have a need to be very hopefully able to get Github's support and resolution."We have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice".

Our company created a Repository called "columbus" in August last year, which contained creators, contents and domain name(wz-inc.com) are all owned by the company, then due to management needs, we asked the relevant personnel to delete this Repository.Later found that before we deleted, the user named suevip completely forked our entire Repository "columbus", and it still exist. The following is Github's URLs and Screenshots about our forked Repository "columbus":

https://github.com/suevip/columbus/commit/f6564435f556139df53991f775ed1b152f4d75e0

Since "columbus" contains our company's important source code, algorithm and system configuration information, belonging to the company's internal data assets, so we hope Github as soon as possible to help us completely remove suevip/columbus and thank you very much!
