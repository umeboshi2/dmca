Dear Sir or Madam:

We have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. We serve as counsel to Citigroup Inc. and its subsidiaries ("Citigroup"). We are writing on behalf of our client with respect to certain proprietary software code belonging to Citigroup (the "CITI Code") that has been posted by GitHub user borderNull to the following code repository page on github.com: https://github.com/borderNull/citibank (the "Repository"). The CITI Code was developed by or on behalf of Citigroup or its related companies, and is not authorized by Citigroup to be on the Repository.

This letter further confirms that we have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by Citigroup, or its agent, or the law. We have taken fair use into consideration.[1] In addition, we are acting as an authorized representative of Citigroup, and we are copying [private], Citigroup, as a confirmation of such authorization. I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Accordingly, we and Citigroup request that github.com take all appropriate steps to remedy this situation, including the immediate removal of the CITI Code from the Repository.

Please confirm that you have or immediately will remove the CITI Code, or reply with any queries to [private].

[1] Please note that under United States Copyright Law, 17 U.S.C. Section 512, github.com has a legal obligation to act expeditiously to remove infringing material upon receiving notice from a copyright owner or its agent concerning such infringement. There is no requirement under United States copyright law to present a copyright registration, and indeed copyright protection under United States law arises upon creation of a copyrighted work.

Sincerely,

[private]
