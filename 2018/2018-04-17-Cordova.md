Dear Github,

As the owner of this repository (https://github.com/mapsplugin/cordova-plugin-googlemaps),
I send this DMCA Takewdown request to this repository (https://github.com/BeMyEye/cordova-plugin-googlemaps).

I provide my code with the Apache LICENSE v2, however I have been added additional clause here.  
https://github.com/mapsplugin/cordova-plugin-googlemaps/blob/master/LICENSE#L203-L205

This clause has been added on Feb/23/2018.

Since, the company BeMyEye forked my repository before on the day,
I admit they modify the code on forked repository,  
but I don't admit to copy or fork the code from my repository after the day.

I discover they breaks this clause on this commit.  
https://github.com/BeMyEye/cordova-plugin-googlemaps/commit/074b0f8333579a294b4fd1cc7f1d35bafea4e159

I even warned couple of times, but they ignored them.  
https://github.com/BeMyEye/cordova-plugin-googlemaps/commit/074b0f8333579a294b4fd1cc7f1d35bafea4e159#commitcomment-28354286  
https://github.com/BeMyEye/cordova-plugin-googlemaps/issues/10  
https://github.com/BeMyEye/cordova-plugin-googlemaps/issues/11

This is enough reason to submit this request.
