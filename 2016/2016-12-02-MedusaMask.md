Dear Sir or Madam,

I am the [private] and [private] of this image

http://rainerkalwitz.daportfolio.com/gallery/860480#7

Furthermore my image has been altered without my permission and the face has been changed
 
This is a clear copyright infringement, as I did not give permission to use my image or parts of my image to this user or this group of people and I don't want my image to be used in such a context.

Furthermore they are not giving credit to the original artist.

I don't have any contact information e.g. an e-mail address of your user, so I can not get in contact with them directlyâ€¦ and I will definitely not become a member of your page just to get in contact with them.

"I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice."

"I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law."

"I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed."

1)

Please remove the image IMMEDIATELY!
2)

Please inform the person who did upload this image to get in contact with me a.s.a.p. so that I can discuss with them an appropriate damage fee for the unauthorized usage of my image. Otherwise www.arsny.com will take over the case and contact you and your user with further costs.

I am a member in the German copyright society and collecting company www.bildkunst.de and  they are associated with ARS (ARTISTS RIGHTS SOCIETY) in New York, www.arsny.com.

Thank you.

Sincerely,
