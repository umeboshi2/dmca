Hello,

This is an official DMCA notice - I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

The unauthorized and infringing copy can be found at the following URLS. Most of the repositories contain code or reference to code including sensitive information with regards to -

1. Internal URLS
2. User Credentials
3. Critical module codes
4. Business Logic

List of URLS/Repositories

https://github.com/tongc/temp/ <https://github.com/tongc/temp/tree/master/temp> - Contains user credentials/internal URLS/Server Names

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Should you wish to further discuss this with me, please reply to this email directly.

Regards,
Expedia, Inc.
