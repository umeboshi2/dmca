Virtual Serial Port Driver is a serial port emulation program that is focused on creating pairs of virtual communication ports. With the help of this efficient utility, serial applications can exchange data via a virtual null-modem cable, connecting COM ports in pairs. Thanks to advanced functionality provided by VSPD, all data written to one serial port is immediately available for reading from the other one and vice versa.
