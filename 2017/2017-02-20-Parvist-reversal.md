GitHub has reconsidered the takedown notice previously processed and published at:

https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2017/2017-02-10-Parvist.md

Upon further consideration, GitHub has determined that this notice does not meet the requirements for a takedown notice under our DMCA Takedown Policy because the code that has been targeted for removal is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License, which appears to be satisfied by the accused project.

Accordingly, GitHub has decided to reject this and any other notice related to this licensed content and restore any content previously disabled due to this notice. We regret any inconvenience that may have been caused by GitHub not catching the deficiencies in these notices sooner. If you have been affected by this takedown notices and have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.
