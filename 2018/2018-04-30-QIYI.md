Hi! Github,  
We are QIYI.com Inc.It is nice to be able to use Github such a professional and efficient platform, and now we have a need to be very hopefully able to get Github's support and resolution.  
We have read and understand Github's Guide to Filling a DMCA Notice.  
Our company trainee created a Repository called "isomorphism.iqiyi" in sinbargit at Feb 6th, which contained some project configuration information(eg: database username and password) are all owned by the company.Later found that before we deleted, the user named (huaciwei, huaciwei-git1, huaciwei-git2, huaciwei-git3, huaciwei-git4, huaciwei-git5) completely forked our entire repository, and it still exists  
The following is Github's URL and Screenshots about our forked repository:

1) repository URL:

Since isomorphism.iqiyi contains the company's important source code, algorithm and system configuration information, belonging to the company's internal data assets, so we hope Github as soon as possible to help us completely remove forked (huaciwei/isomorphism.iqiyi, huaciwei-git1/isomorphism.iqiyi, huaciwei-git2/isomorphism.iqiyi, huaciwei-git3/isomorphism.iqiyi, huaciwei-git4/isomorphism.iqiyi, huaciwei-git5/isomorphism.iqiyi) and thank you very much!.
