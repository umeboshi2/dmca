**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**  
Yes

**What work was allegedly infringed? If possible, please provide a URL:**  
Taiba project.  
This project was created by my student - fann1993814 (https://github.com/fann1993814)  
It includes various lexical resources and tools of my lab (CKIP) without my permission and all of them have copyright. (Just name a few: http://www.aclclp.org.tw/use_wlawf.php, http://ckipsvr.iis.sinica.edu.tw/)  

fann1993814 already admitted his mistake and taken down the project from github. (Please see https://github.com/fann1993814/Taiba/blob/master/README.md) In fact, he ever requested a DMCA takedown but at that time he answered NO to the first question about copyright owner, so you rejected to handle it. Actually he should answer YES since he acted on the copyright owner's (my) behalf to file the DMCA notice.  
The following two people reproduced his project and we can not find their contact information:   
https://github.com/smilechun/Taiba  
https://github.com/hsuan40/Taiba  
in order to notice them.  

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository's URL:**  
All Taiba project (requested by its creater - fann1993814 and its copyright owner - me)

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  
Yes. At this point, everyone who left their contact information was noticed by us and took down the project.  
Only  
https://github.com/smilechun/Taiba  
https://github.com/hsuan40/Taiba  
do not provide their contact information on github so we can not notice them.  

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**  
No.  

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**  
No. Both the project creater - fann1993814 and the copyright owner - me are requesting the removal.
