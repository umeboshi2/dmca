Hello.

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

I am writing this DMCA to try and takedown copyrighted work based on Disney’s Toontown Online which closed in 2013.

This project is a non-profit adaptation of Disney’s Toontown Online. Me and a team of 7 collaborators in the past have made adaptations to audio, graphical assets, client and server-sided code. The server-sided code makes this project unique and has been adapted, although, original works were done by Toontown Rewritten, one of the first adaptations.

This particular project has been in development since 2014 and all our efforts are now publicly available. The repository in question is located at: 

https://github.com/malverde/Toontown-World-Online-Leak/

The original code is hosted on a private instance on GitLab: [private] a private repository – but an older copy remains under my account [private] on GitHub titled “Toontown World Online”. The Git from GitLab has been imported onto GitHub – this user “malverde” was just accepted to work with us as a volunteer but decided to leak our source code. He has not had permission to make our code public.

I would have all of my content removed from the infringing repo and its forks. These forks contain no edits but simply taking a copy of my team’s hard work, potentially using it for their own ends. Links to these forks can be found at:

https://github.com/Spiderlover/Toontown-World-Online 
https://github.com/ttpeppermint2011/Toontown-World-Online-Leak.

Please note the following commit is a SSL certificate and I can only assume they mean to run our code themselves:

My contact details are:

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Thank you,
