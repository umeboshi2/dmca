Hi, I developed an app and uploaded on Codecayone here is the link :

https://codecanyon.net/item/currency-converter-admob-ready/18294113

Now someone purchased it and uploaded the complete app on github here.

https://github.com/samanyougarg/Currency-Converter-Android

Pleaes check the date and time of both apps.
I uploaded the app on codecayone.net on 13 october 2016 and the github user uplaoded it on the github on 21 october 2016.
Please remove the source code from github.
