Hello i already tried to take that down but everytime you ask for 1 more information....

I have developped a project a league of legends queue bot called ezBot.
I used to share it online on elobuddy.net admins there know who i am [private].

But i removed it from my github few months ago because i was working on a new better bot which is now paid.
( See my deleted repository and old commits for ez_source in HesaElobuddy repo )

After going into paid version someone leaked my old source code and updated it to the latest game version and now compete my paid software with my old free software.

I asked him to remove it from the forum and from github, he did from the forum but never did from github and he never logged back, so im unable to contact him.

This is kinda lame because atm anyone can download the source code and use my own work to bypass my work.

The new bot is alot better and has more features but still this is frustrating.

Also when using github search and searching for "ezbot" we can find a few with the source code.

Which has been posted there: https://www.elobuddy.net/topic/49160-ezbot-73-auto-queue/  
And he gave credits to this fetus even tho they are using MY banner which a friend made for me.
