Original content: https://github.com/NotGGhost/Discord-Client-Modding/blob/master/Quoting.js

The infringed content can be found in an installer under releases (https://github.com/Bluscream/BetterDiscord/releases/download/1.3/BetterDiscord.Setup.exe), which can be seen once you open it up in an archive program, such as 7zip. The file can be found in the root directory under the name "Quoting.js". Once opened up in the correct manor, you can see the infringed content, which resembles the original content, whilst showing his unauthorized edits.

The original content is licensed under all rights reserved, and hereby gives all rights to the original creator ("Ghost"). The individual known as "Bluscream", as I've spoke to him on several occasions has refused to remove the content indefinitely, and will not give credits, therefore we are taking action against this repository as this has been redistributed and modified in an unauthorized manner.

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
