**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**   
I am [private] for Daybreak Game Company LLC, formerly known as Sony Online Entertainment LLC and the rightful owner of the copyright in the video game Free Realms.

**What work was allegedly infringed? If possible, please provide a URL:**  

Free Realms was a massively multiplayer role playing PC and PlayStation 3 game by Daybreak (formerly SOE), released in 2009 and closed by Daybreak in 2014. Daybreak retains exclusive ownership of this game and the distribution of its code, game files, and/or game assets on github is unauthorized. Such hosting and distribution violates Daybreak's exclusive trademark rights and exclusive rights of reproduction, distribution, and public display under Section 106 of the Copyright Act, is a breach of Daybreak's end user license agreement, and constitutes a tortious interference with the contracts and business relationships that Daybreak has with hundreds of thousands of game players. www.freerealms.com redirects to Daybreak's main company page now, but I can provide further attachments upon request.

The Free Realms end user license agreement, which each user must have affirmatively agreed to in order to install the game, prohibits users from infringing any intellectual property rights and distribution of Free Realms-related copyrighted material.

Section 106 of the Copyright Act provides that the copyright owner, here Daybreak, has the exclusive right to do or authorize, among other things, the following: reproduce the copyrighted work, prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work, distribute copies of the copyrighted work to the public, and public display the copyrighted work. Copyright Act Section 501 provides that anyone who violates any of the exclusive rights of the copyright owner is liable for direct infringement of the copyright, here Free Realms. Remedies for infringement that may be imposed by a federal court include preliminary and permanent injunctions (Section 502) and actual or statutory damages (Section 504).

The github user [private] has posted client and server code of Daybreak's game Free Realms:

"This archive contains the works of Joshsora (https://www.GitHub.com/Joshsora/)  
It includes:  

- All of the coding and reverse engineering done by Joshsora in it's final state.  
- A pre-built version of the final server.  
- The packet logs supplied by Womayhem.  
- Utilities created by Joshsora to aid development.  

Sadly, the WebAPI has been lost so none of this works, but it's easy enough to reproduce if you have the source code.  

NOTE:

This server will not get you past the loading screen, as that part was never figured out.
The loading screen does not complete because the game hangs waiting for "character data".
The client does think that it has joined a world, and has successfully logged in.

For anyone who is not a developer, THIS IS NOT PLAYABLE!
