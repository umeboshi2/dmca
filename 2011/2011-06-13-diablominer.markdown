I am the author of [DiabloMiner](https://github.com/Diablo-D3/DiabloMiner) and I have been recently notified that speedygonzalez aka Alex Gonzales has been redistributing my project in binary only form in violation of my Copyright and the GNU Public License, as seen here: <https://github.com/speedygonzalez/OptDiabloMinerII/>

I have tried to contact him, as have others, using the email address he has provided and he refuses to respond. I suspect the binary he has released contains a trojan because he has ran the binary through a Java obfusicator.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyright materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by me or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

You may contact me by email or by physical address:
