I am the owner of the content in question. I authored it and am the copyright holder accordingly.

**What files were taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository's URL:**

**Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?**  
There was formerly a reference to a wellsfargo subdomain in the codebase (Wells Fargo is the entity issuing the takedown notice) which I have removed as a courtesy, however Wells Fargo does not have a copyright on this url and I can see no legal reason I should need to remove it.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake? (optional)**  
No, but I'd like to point out to the complaining party that because they submitted a batch takedown notice for multiple users I and another 5 or 6 people have been notified of a file containing Wells Fargo DB passwords I had no idea about previously. I suggest they stop doing that.
