Before access to it was disabled, the material was available at

I state, under penalty of perjury, that I believe the material was
disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material
to be removed or disabled.

I interpret the basis of the [take-down][dmca] to be (1) Perseus holding
the copyright of _The Feynman Lectures on Physics_, (2) files in the
repository infringing upon that material. I don't believe either basis
is valid: (1) Caltech hold the copyright, Perseus only have print
publishing rights, the integrity of the notice relies on Perseus having
been authorised to act on behalf of Caltech; (2) none of Caltech's
content is included in the repository, all it contains are a set of
scripts to process material [provided by others][book].

I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial
district of California, and will accept service of process from the
person who provided notification or an agent of such person.
