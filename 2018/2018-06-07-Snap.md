Dear Abuse Agent:

We represent Snap Inc. (“Snap”) in intellectual property matters. Snap is the owner of all copyright in and to the Ghost Design shown below, as registered with the U.S. Copyright Office U.S. Registration Number VA0002014816, dated 2016-08-25<http://cocatalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?Search_Arg=snapchat&Search_Code=NALL&PID=XPcToPfOFiIElsAKk9DUIETfjZig&SEQ=20180212141627&CNT=25&HIST=1> (“Snap Intellectual Property”). 

An example of Snap’s use of the protected work is at https://www.snap.com/en-US/.

A website using your services located at http://snapchatback.com/ has copied without authorization Snap Intellectual Property. Specifically, the website is using the Ghost Design in its browser tab and header.

We request your assistance in the removal of infringement of Snap Intellectual Property from http://snapchatback.com/, pursuant to Title II of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act(17 USC § 512).

Snap has the good faith belief that the use of the Snap Intellectual Property in the manner complained of is not authorized by Snap, its agent or the law, and is not defensible. Snap diligently enforces its rights in and to the Snap Intellectual Property in all forms and rightfully takes its responsibility for protection of the Snap Intellectual Property very seriously.

We further declare under penalty of perjury that we are authorized to act on behalf of Snap and that the information in this letter is accurate.
