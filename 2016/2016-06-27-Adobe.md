I, [private], have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice <https://help.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/>.

Without authorization, on or about May 23, 2015, GitHub user [private] <https://github.com/niksvers> published intellectual property owned by Day Software to his GitHub repository. On October 28, 2010 Adobe Systems completed acquisition of Day Software.<http://www.adobe.com/investor-relations/day-acquisition.html> Specifically, the file global.jsp (attached) is owned by Adobe Systems, includes a copyright notice, and is available to customers of Adobe Systems only through an signed, executed Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).

The alleged infringement is found on [private]'s GitHub site, here <https://github.com/niksvers/myproject/blob/master/content/src/main/content/jcr_root/libs/foundation/global.jsp>.

For the reasons stated above, we respectfully ask that [private] completely remove this file and any references to it from GitHub.

Our investigation suggests [private] can be reached as follows:

* GitHub user: niksvers <https://github.com/niksvers>

* Gmail: [private]

* LinkedIn: [private]

I tried to contact [private] directly at the above Gmail address but received no response.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
