Dear Sir or Madam:

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

The contents of the entire repository located at

https://github.com/anath-mdsol/ravegarage 

are a non-authorized, unlicensed,
and infringing copy of Medidata Solutions Inc.'s copyrighted [PRIVATE]
code. 

*Thus, I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted
materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by
the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law*.

Pursuant to Step 6 of Github's takedown policy
<https://help.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy/#f-submitting-notices>,
we request that Github disable the repository (
https://github.com/anath-mdsol/ravegarage) as soon as possible, as the
entire contents of the repository are covered by Medidata's copyrights.

In an attempt to avoid sending Github this DMCA Takedown Notice (made under
Section 512(c) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act), I contacted the
repository owner [PRIVATE] [PRIVATE] to request he take down the
repository. [PRIVATE] told me that he has no problem with the repository
being taken down, but that he is too busy to do so. [PRIVATE] is a former
employee of Medidata Solutions, Inc.

*I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this
notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am
authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is
allegedly infringed*.

Finally, in addition to my name and contact information and [PRIVATE]'s name
and contact information which I understand Github will redact from its
publication of this DMCA Takedown Notice, please also redact the phrase "
[PRIVATE]".

Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions.

Regards,

[PRIVATE]
