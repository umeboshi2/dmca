**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  
Yes. Found one fork, which has been added to the list above.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**  
The work is licensed under a closed source license, which the users have violated by including it in a public GIT repository.  

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**  
The users should remove the EVP5 folder and all its contents from the repository and from the entire project's history, for all the repositories containing it.  

A quick look at the other contents of these repositories shows that many of them contain more commercial Unity Assets. These users should learn that they cannot post public projects that contain commercial assets, as these are always copyrighted work under closed source license.  

**Do you have the alleged infringer's contact information? If so, please provide it:**
