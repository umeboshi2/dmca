**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright
owner's behalf?**  

YES.

All the rights to SmartTiles and associated source code, intellectual
property, trademarks, etc., were acquired by our legal Partnership,
Thingterfaces LP (managed by its general partner, Thingterfaces Inc;
[private]) in January 2017.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work
that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where
it is posted online.**

The Groovy source code of the main module of SmartTiles v5.x.y (web user
interface for SmartThings) was prefixed with header comments (or
equivalent) asserting Copyright [private] 2014, and Licensed
prohibiting "distribution".

NB: Publication on non-private GitHub repositories is clearly and
reasonably considered as "distribution".

Any modified public versions that are referenced are violations of the
"may not modify this software *without distributing it*" License clause.

[private] retained the Copyright (and right to
enforce the License Term of "no distribution"), until transferring all
rights to Thingterfaces LP in January 2017.

First commit that was named "SmartTiles" is in [private] Private Repo at:
