Hi GitHub,

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Counter Notice. As a result, I would like to counter a false, malicious claim on one of my repositories which is the result of [private] (Amazon Engineer) being hostile, controlling and harassing towards me via email.

Amazon is the owner of the Lumberyard Engine which is open source and available here: https://github.com/aws/lumberyard After strict reviewing of the license, terms and conditions. I'm quite clueless as to why my repository has been taken down. I own the game specific code I wrote that runs on-top of this engine. I have made significant unpublished changes to the codebase at engine level which I can no longer publish due to my fork being taken down.

The URL to the repository that has been taken down is:  
https://github.com/Gh0stBlade/Lumberyard/

I would like the repository reinstated as soon as possible since I'm developing a game with the Amazon Lumberyard Engine. As a result of this take down, it has incurred serious delays on my project.

[private] bribed somehow obtained the email for one of the collaborators who works on a project with me, published on my GitHub profile. I'm not sure how he did this but he clearly hacked to obtain this information as my friend claimed he does not have an Amazon account thus a name look up would not be possible. [private] offered a $100 Amazon Gift Card if my friend passed on the message to me which he did. As a result, [private] Claims that "Note it is a license requirement that your fork be parented to the official Amazon version." This is not stated anywhere in their licensing terms thus is void and illegal application of licensing ethics.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.

I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.

I, [private] confirm that I have read your Guide to Submitting a DMCA Counter Notice: https://help.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-counter-notice/
