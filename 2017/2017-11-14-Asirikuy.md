I am the copyright owner for Asirikuy.com. The repository here: https://github.com/forex-guru/project-zero. Has posted code that is copyrighted by Asirikuy.com. You can see that the license and end-user agreement are still present on the source files (for example this one https://github.com/forex-guru/project-zero/blob/master/dev/AsirikuyCommon/src/AsirikuyTime.c). The end-user agreement clearly specifies under distribution:  
  
"You may not distribute copies of the Asirikuy Framework in binary or source forms to third parties outside of the Asirikuy community."  
  
This repository is in clear violation of the code's end-user agreement so I request it - and its branches - be taken down.  
  
I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.  
  
I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
