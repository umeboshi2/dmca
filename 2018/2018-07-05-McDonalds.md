Dear Sirs,  
We are NetNames Brand Protection Limited, a brand protection and internet monitoring company. McDonald's has instructed us to take action in relation to internet activities that infringe their intellectual property and pose risks to their customers.  
This message is to request the immediate removal of, or disabling of access to, the page listed in this message that is currently hosted on your website:  
Infringing Page:  
https://github.com/kbeflo/evilportals/commit/1d5261fd0d302dc28ffc4d5bac382b2a9f833a63  
The description of the infringement:  
The identified page contains code for an "Evil Portal" login page. The commit contains McDonald's logo and code designed to create a log-in portal in order to capture McDonald's employee or customer credentials. The post is part of a larger repository titled "kbeflo/evilportals".  
Evil Portal is described as "a captive portal module created by frozenjava for the Hak5 Wifi Pineapple. This repository contains a collection of portals that can be loaded into the Evil Portal module and can be used to capture credentials."  
WiFi Pineapple is known as a "hotspot honeypot." When WiFi Pineapple is activated, it steals the credentials of legitimate WiFi networks that users have accessed in the past, tricking users to access the fake access point created by WiFi Pineapple and allowing hackers to steal passwords and other data.  
Evil Portal appears to be a module that allows hackers to modify the WiFi Pineapple to present users with illegitimate log-in screens.
It is clear that for the protection of MCDONALD'S employees and customers, we have to ask for this to be removed.
