Hello!

I am the original author of unofficial RTMPE Handshake 10 patch for utility
rtmpdump. This patch became by mistake publicly accessed on various sites. Even
more - this patch was not dedicated to be stored at open-source sites, but
person with nickname 'svnpenn' uploaded it and now he refuses to delete it. The
main problem of this patch is that it contains some binary data from Adobe Flash
Player executable and it may infringe copyright under some circumstances. I do
not want to be responsible for people who may use proof of concept code in wrong
purposes.

Below are URLs that contain infringing files:<br>
<https://github.com/svnpenn/rtmpdump/blob/264f508706b5302821ef7de774ee7e423566d3dc/librtmp/rtmpe10.c><br>
<https://github.com/svnpenn/rtmpdump/blob/264f508706b5302821ef7de774ee7e423566d3dc/librtmp/rtmpe10.h>

Branch with this patch is located at <https://github.com/svnpenn/rtmpdump/commit/264f>

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described in
all notifications submitted through the Program as allegedly infringing is not
authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.

The information in all notifications submitted through the Program will be
accurate, and I swear, under penalty of perjury, that with respect to those
notifications, I am the copyright owner or am authorized to act on behalf of the
owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Regards,
