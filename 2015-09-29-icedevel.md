All the games are from our development website http://icedevel.com/

As ultimate proof that we are the respective owners of the intellectual
property I would like to show the predecessor of the game Bottle On
Head, which was made in flash and has been published in March 2013 here:

You can see on the left side of the screen under the credits, the last
update date, which was March 21, 2013! We reworked that title in html5
javascript and published in 2015.
