This repository is simply a personal fork of [private]. As can be seen in the repository itself, the software was released under the MIT license, which remains intact with all credit to the original author. Among other things, the license explicitly grants the rights to use, copy, modify, and publish the software. Nothing I have done has violated that license, so there is no justification for this take down.

I believe it is possible that the author released a later version of the software under a more restrictive license and has mistaken the contents of my repository for that version. However, if such a version exists, I have not seen it personally. Therefore, I am certain no part of it exists within my repository.
