Hi,

I recently discovered that our premium script is available for free on
GitHub.

Script name is "Dynamic Website Compressor" which can be purchased from

http://codecanyon.net/item/dynamic-website-compressor/2838376
under "Regular License". The license information can be seen here
http://codecanyon.net/licenses/terms/regular

It is not allowed to distribute the codes and can be used for the single
end product.

The repositories that contain our codes and script can be seen here

* https://github.com/huynt57/bluebee.com
* https://github.com/huynt57/realtime-website
* https://github.com/huynt57/VipService

I noticed, that these repos contains our code under `compressor.php` file
which is included in the different folder.

* In `huynt57/bluebee.com` base directory `compressor.php` file and
`protected/components/compressor.php`
* In `huynt57/realtime-website` in base directory `compressor.php` file.
* In `huynt57/VipService` in `protected/components/compressor.php` file.
