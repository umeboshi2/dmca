To whom it may concern,

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

I would like to file a DMCA notice for the removal of 3 repositories, which we believe are exact copies of source-code owned exclusively by the company Rakuten ShowTime, Inc.
The company website can be found via the following link:
http://video.rakuten.co.jp/static/company/

All following information is the result of a thorough investigation into the infringing repositories. Our statements are 100% truthful.

We understand the complicated nature of filing a DMCA notice. To make this notice as uncomplicated and easy-to-understand as possible, please allow me to organize it in same way as the Your Complaint Must section of GitHubs Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice.

\#2) Identify the copyrighted work you believe has been infringed.

For security reasons, please do not publicly display the information contained in this section (section #2)

The infinging repository is an un-altered fork of the original repository; however, the two differ in that the publicy available product is a higher version than the program found in the infringing repository.

The original repositoy was deleted when the owner learned that its contents were copyrighted material. One is able to contact the original repository owner via their github account [redacted].

The following validation libraries are included in the forked repository. These libraries were authorized exclusively for use by the copyright holder.

\#3) Identify the material that you allege is infringing the copyrighted work listed in item #2, above.

1) iOS Application

URL: https://github.com/iVideo/Rakuten-Video-iOS  
GitHub account name: iVideo  
Repository name: Rakuten-Video-iOS

\#4) Explain what the affected user would need to do in order to remedy the infringement.

We request that the owners of the repositories listed in #3 delete the repositories completely.
Although the infringing repositories are older versions of the applications listed in #2, they clearly contain the name of the owning company. The company name itself has no meaning; therefore, we are certain that the names of these repositories signify the name of the owning company.

\#5) Provide your contact information.  

1. Email [private] or [private]  
2. Name [private]  
3. Tel [private]  
4. Address [private]

2) Android Application

GitHub account name: yhwang0916  
Repository name: AndroidRakutenVideoPlayer  

GitHub account name: TruiGo

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the
infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.  
I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and
that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner,
of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

\#9) Include your physical or electronic signature.

[private]

We have made this notice as specific as possible.
We believe completely that the above repositories are direct copies of works
owned and operated exclusively by Rakuten-Showtime,
and that they are not authorized on behalf of the owner.

If you find the above evidence unsubstantial, we would sincerely appreciate
your feedback as to why is it unsubstantial, and how we can go about
removing these infringing repositories.

Thank you very much for your time,
