Hi！Github,  
We are QIYI.com Inc. It is nice to be able to use Github such a professional and efficient platform, and now we have a need to be very hopefully able to get Github’s support and resolution.  
We have read and understand Github’s Guide to Filling a DMCA Notice.  
Our company trainee created a Repository called "thymeleaf-webproject” in [private] at Mar 7th, which contained some project configuration information(eg: database username and password) are all
owned by the company.Later found that before we deleted, the user named huaciwei-git1 and huaciwei completely forked our entire repository, and it still exists
The following is Github’s URL and Screenshots about our forked repository:
