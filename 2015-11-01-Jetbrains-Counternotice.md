Dear GitHub Copyright Agent:

With regard to the takedown notice: https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2015-09-22-jetbrains.md,

Access to the following repository have been disabled:

https://github.com/mlizhenbin/common-lang/blob/master/common-lang/src/test/java/cn/lzb/common/common/keygen.java

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Counter Notice."

I declare, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good faith belief that the complaint of copyright violation is based on mistaken information, misidentification of the material in question, or deliberate misreading of the law.

I also declare that the repositories might have contained copyrighted material which was promptly removed after its notification.

My name, address, and telephone number are as follows:

+ name：[PRIVATE]
+ address： [PRIVATE]
+ mobile：[PRIVATE]

I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.

Best Regards,

[PRIVATE]
