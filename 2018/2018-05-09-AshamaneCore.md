**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**  
[private] - this is our main (and only) repository for our project. This is being developed privately by a team of legally paid developers and most of them have signed Non Disclosure Agreements.  
Unfortunately it has been brought to my attention that the following public repository https://github.com/AshamaneProject/AshamaneCore has published a lot of commits in the past period containing identical, copy paste content from our private repository, from committer [private] which is not affiliated with us.  
As mentioned our project was done under strict NDA agreements so this means someone breached their NDA and shared our work with this [private] individual, directly or indirectly. We will pursue legal action to find out who is the actual culprit. While this is probably not github's concern, our guess is the breacher of his NDA is [private] ([private] is the commiter name from our repository). Please see attached file [private] which shows a partial, extremely redacted NDA agreement between us and [private] (real name [private])

Most important infringement:

https://github.com/AshamaneProject/AshamaneCore/blob/edefffca2db60fd289bb91ce5588ccc9801b0488/src/common/Common.h (revision edefffca2db60fd289bb91ce5588ccc9801b0488 dated on Oct 24, 2017)  
Lines 153 - 332 can be found as an exact copy of [private]

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository's URL:**

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  
---

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**  
No, this is closed source.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**
