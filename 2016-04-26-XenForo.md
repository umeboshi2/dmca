To Whom It May Concern,

My name is [private] and I am a representative of XenForo, Ltd.

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

This letter is official notification under Section 512(c) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (”DMCA”), and the following materials have been found to be infringing on the copyright of XenForo, Ltd. by distributing the copyrighted software, XenForo (https://xenforo.com):

https://github.com/siveeran/xenforo-ptool  
https://github.com/url84t/xenforo  
https://github.com/Bluscream1/XenForo-1.5.5  
https://github.com/Minisiteku/Xenforo  
https://github.com/url84t/xenforo/tree/master/xenforo  
https://github.com/ltthang88/XenForo  
https://github.com/mars236/Sando  
https://github.com/misterhuy/Forum-XenForo  

XenForo's license agreement does not permit the distribution of XenForo.

I request that you immediately remove the specified materials and prevent the infringer, who is identified by its web address, from posting the infringing materials to your servers in the future. Please be advised that law requires you, as a service provider, to "expeditiously remove or disable access to" the infringing materials upon receiving this notice. Noncompliance may result in a loss of immunity for liability under the DMCA.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Regards,
