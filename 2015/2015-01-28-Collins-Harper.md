To Whom It May Concern,

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described
here
https://help.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/
on the
infringing web pages is not authorized by us the copyright owner, or its
agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this
notification is accurate and that I am
the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an
exclusive right that is
allegedly infringed.

This user has posted work that infriges on our proprietary software:

http://www.collinsharper.com/modules/shipping-modules/canada-post-v2-web-services.html

These are the posts that infringe, the hosted content is a direct, literal
copy of our work:

This is the user, whom we have tried to contact to resolve twice by email,
which is the only
communication we have for them:

The user needs to remove the work, namely disable / delete the content.
