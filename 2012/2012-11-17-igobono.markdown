Dear Sir Madam,

I am a partner at the law firm of Schmidt, Volsky & Perle LLP., and the acting CEO and General Counsel for igobono, inc. (www.igobono.com).

Our firm represents igobono with respect to a copyright violation that we recently discovered. A coder misappropriated our code and has published it to a public repository, representing it as his own.

Recently, we discovered that the coder published the code we sent him for purposes of providing a quote to his GitHub repository, ostensibly claiming it as his own. The code can be found in [igobono_vj](https://github.com/djdon11/igobono_vj), [https://github.com/djdon11](https://github.com/djdon11)

Accordingly, I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am authorized to act on  behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

We respectfully request GitHub to promptly remove the code from the developerâ€™s repository forthwith. Thank you in advance for your assistance.  

Please feel free to contact me at [private]
