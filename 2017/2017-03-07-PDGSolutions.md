Dear Github,

My company PDG Solutions, recently hired a contractor remotely and after a week he declined the job offer and steal all our code and he now publish it on GitHub.

He created an account on Github using our company name and publish our private code at https://github.com/pdg-solutions.

I list here our private repositories along with the repositories that are infringing our copyright (our repositories / their repository):

[Private] => https://github.com/pdg-solutions/credenciales-api  
[Private] => https://github.com/pdg-solutions/credenciales-webapp  
[Private] => https://github.com/pdg-solutions/insight-clients  
[Private] => https://github.com/pdg-solutions/insight-api  
[Private] => https://github.com/pdg-solutions/insight-webapp  

If you check the user activity you’ll see that the user didn’t commit to the project. I can send proves that those projects are ours and the code is exactly the same by a 100%.

This person did this on propose to request money on exchange, the code is the hostage.

We request to take down the account and close the user account.

The owner of this account must at least, unpublished those projects.

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Thank you very much.
