We at TradingView give access to our charting library to those, who are willing to integrate the charting solution into their website and integrate their data into it. The process of getting access to the library, which is stored in a private repository in GitHub at [private] , is given only after signing the license agreement with us and filling out the application for on our website. Paragraph 7 of the license agreement states that noone is allowed to put the charting library in fool or partially or any file or component of it into the public repository. In this case everyone would be able to get access to it. None of these users described below in the infrigement list ever asked to get access to the repository nor signed any agreement with us.

Removal only as we won't be able to track them. We couldn't find these users in our collaborators or customers list, means the library was stolen.
