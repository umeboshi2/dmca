Dear GitHub Copyright Agent,

The following repository contains a plugin that was originally written by me and my colleague as a closed source plugin, It is not free software and the repository owner distributes it illegally.

You can find it as MircoORM on our downloads page:  
http://www.systegrator.com/downloads.html

Both release archives in the link bellow contain the plugin.

https://github.com/ClashGameBot/CGB/releases

The file is located inside the archive in the "lib" folder and was renamed to CGBPlugin.dll (it is the exact same file).

In order to resolve this infringement the user would have to remove this DLL file from the repository and his release archives.

My details are

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials
described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the
copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this
notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner of an
exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Trying to contact the repository owner yielded no response.

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

I would appreciate your swift handling of the issue.
