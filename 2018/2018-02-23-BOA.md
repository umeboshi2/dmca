Hello GitHub Team,

Per my recent email correspondence with the Github support team, I was asked to submit a DMCA request to have the content on https://github.com/gitpan/Business-OnlinePayment-BankOfAmerica removed for containing BAC proprietary code. I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

Bank of America is the owner of the copyright in its Stripes Design:
