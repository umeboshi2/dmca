To Github,

 So far, there are still a number of violations of the repo did not delete, such as the following 2 links,I am the copyright owner of the source code , but they are infringing：   
https://github.com/zhufenggood/yougou-mobile  
https://github.com/BigMaster/NewEBuy/tree/master/sourceCode  


At the same time, I found that there are 2 new repo, the code is completely consistent with my code, I believe they are infringing my code:   
https://github.com/yuer3385/NewEBuy-master  
https://github.com/ita9178/NewEBuy-master  

I would like to remove and disable the above repositories due to infringement of our codebase. I have since reviewed and investigated a substantial amount of forked repos (example listed below). All the forked repos are infringing to the same extent as the parent repository. I would like to remove and disable all the forked repositories as well.
