Hello,

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

After my takedown notice for https://github.com/laravelish/EasyAdmin, as
per your suggestion, I investigated all forks and all of them are the same
as "laravelish/EasyAdmin", except "wipflash/EasyAdmin" who has updated the
readme.md file, but that does not change anything, he still uses the same
source code that is actually my CodeCanyon item called Vanguard (
http://codecanyon.net/item/vanguard-advanced-php-login-and-user-management/14521866)
which is not released under open source licence.

Here is the list of all available forks (which is also available at
https://github.com/abedputra/EasyAdmin/network/members):
