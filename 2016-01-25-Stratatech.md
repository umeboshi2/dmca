DMCA Takedown Request

Hi, my name is [private] and I am [private] at Stratatech Ltd. company (stratatech.ru). I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

It has come to my attention that a user of Github is infringing on at least one copyright owned by my company, through a posting to your website. It appears that the user, rkmarvin is responsible for the violation. The code and project information was copied onto your servers without permission.

The original code/project, to which we own the exclusive copyrights, can be found at: http://gitlab.stratatech.ru/python_vdx/python_vdx

The unauthorized and infringing copy can be found at: https://github.com/rkmarvin/python_vdx/commit/228fc66629273baee1f8600cda8ad17f1560f554

This letter is official notification under Section 512(c) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (”DMCA”), and I seek the removal of the aforementioned infringing material from your servers. I request that you immediately notify the infringer of this notice and inform them of their duty to remove the infringing material immediately, and notify them to cease any further posting of infringing material to your server in the future.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Should you wish to discuss this with me, please contact me directly.

Thank you.
