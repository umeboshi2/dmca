Dear Github support,

My name is [private], I am the [private] for Laverock Von Schoultz Ltd (LVS) located in London England. LVS is the copyright owner for this software. As the copyright owner’s representative I would like to make sure the source code for our software dated 2014 is removed from GitHub along with its branches.

The following link reflect the software that has been copied to GitHub:  
https://github.com/tim-mcnamara/avp  
The original of the software has been renamed to “avp” but the software’s real name is ABP.

Please note that the following “fork” have been identified and shall also be removed:  
https://github.com/wefasdfaew2/avp  
https://github.com/eliaidi/avp  
https://github.com/Deux-lunes/avp  
https://github.com/gongweitao/avp  
https://github.com/Iskuskov/avp  
https://github.com/wefasdfaew2/avp  
https://github.com/XClouded/avp  
https://github.com/gantourki/avp (test done by myself to check the source code)  

LVS is in possession of the Escrow certificate that proves that this source code is the source code that is used to produce our Sports Betting software. We do also possess the original repository of the software along with all the modifications that have been applied to it before the copy on GitHub and after as well.

LVS’ software is in use by multiple clients including our mother company Française des Jeux based out of Paris (France). The software can be used with the link bellow assuming you have been registered to play in France.

The entire repository along with branches should be taken down as soon as possible. I have noticed 6 forks of the software so far that should also be deleted: https://github.com/tim-mcnamara/avp/network/members  

The work is not licensed under open source license.  

Removal is the only option. This is considered as a clear infringement of our Copyright
