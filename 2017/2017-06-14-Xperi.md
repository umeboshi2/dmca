Dear GitHub DMCA Team,

I am writing on behalf of Xperi Corporation and its subsidiaries (including
DTS and SRS Labs), to request that you remove confidential, proprietary,
and copyrighted material belonging to Xperi and its subsidiaries that was
posted without authorization to your website.

We recently became aware that a former employee of one of our customers had
inadvertently posted, among other things, our confidential, proprietary and
copyrighted source code, header files, and libraries to a GitHub
repository. These materials were posted without our knowledge or
authorization, and in violation of our rights under U.S. Copyright law. As
these materials were posted by a former employee, our customer has not able
to remove all of them from your website. In addition we learned that several
GitHub users have replicated this repository and that these replicated
repositories also contain our confidential, proprietary, and copyrighted
materials.

The name of the directory that contains our copyrighted materials is
SRS_AudioEffect. The files contained in this directory are part of our DTS
Sound(TM) audio technology, which, among other things, allows people to
enjoy an expanded stereo image, sonic optimization for internal device
speakers and an immersive virtual surround sound experience over
headphones, restores the rich detail lost during the compression process,
provides bass enhancement and delivers level volume across any type of
content. Additional information about our products can be found at:

http://dts.com/at-home

The files included in the directory mentioned above and its subdirectories
contain copyright statements indicating that they are copyrighted material
of Xperi and its subsidiaries (including DTS and SRS Labs). For example:
