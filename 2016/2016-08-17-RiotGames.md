Hello there!
We'd like to request the takedown of some content that a former contractor of ours has stored in the public sphere with your service.

Let's start with: I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. ;)

I am the [private] for Riot Games. I hired the contractor to create documentation on our behalf. She ended up creating a website and storing assets all over the internet by using free tools. Now we are trying to take down all of the work because she is not responding to our texts and phones calls. Our legal team is sending her a cease and desist and we're trying to get as much of the material down as quickly as possible.

The following links are the links in question:  
1. REPOSITORY: [already removed by user]  
This is very, very bad. Providing pictures and contact information of Rioters can put them in danger.  
2. REPOSITORY: https://github.com/christinegp/rg-localization  
This link features countless screenshots of our proprietary localization management software.  
3. REPOSITORY: https://github.com/christinegp/loc-riotgames.github.io  
Descriptions of how we do things as well as screenshots of proprietary software.  

I don't believe there are any additional forks. The work is not licensed in any way. The best resolution would be to have [private] remove the files but she is not responding to our email, texts, or phone calls. All work (as in each repository in it's entirety) needs to be removed.

[private]'s email is [private]  
[private]'s phone number is [private]
