Dear Sir,
Hello,

I am the author of the persian-hm-xs2 and persian-hm-ftx packages. The first
package contains 22 families of Persian fonts (totally 249 fonts) and the
second one, 19 families (totally 228 fonts). I have created these fonts with
Python Programming Language using the X Series 2 TrueType fonts and Metafont
sources provided in the FarsiTeX distribution.

The latest version of these packages were released on November 23, 2013 and
the licenses are SIL Open Font License (OFL). Please see the following links:

https://bitbucket.org/dma8hm1334/persian-hm-xs2/downloads
https://bitbucket.org/dma8hm1334/persian-hm-ftx/downloads

I had been informed that one of the CTAN users has copied one of the families
(totally 12 fonts) of the persian-hm-ftx package (HM_FElmi*) and uploaded them
under the name '"persian-modern" fonts' on that website.

Therefore, I decided to complain to TeXLive and CTAN authorities and discuss
the situation with them, and finally they decided to remove the
"persian-modern" package from TeXLive and CTAN as well.

Please search for "rm persian-modern, unresolvable conflict with persian-hm"
on:

https://www.tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/?pathrev=35036

You can also ask [private] ([private]) the TeXLive maintainer
or the CTAN administrator ([private]), yourself, if you would like to.

I was informed some days ago that that user has uploaded the fonts on Github
under the name of "vafa" soon after their removal from TeXLive . Please see:

https://github.com/vafa/persian-modern

But after a few days, he deleted the above account and uploaded it under
the name of "zalmehran". Please see:

https://github.com/zalmehran/persian-modern

and surprisingly, I have noticed that he has deleted the above account as well
and uploaded it under another name as "vafak". Please see:

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described
above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner,
or its agent, or the law.

As the rights of these fonts belong to me, it would be gratefully appreciated
if you kindly remove them from your website as well.

Please let me know if you need more information and the evidences that I had
provided with TeXLive and CTAN administrators.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification
is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on
behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

It would be gratefully appreciated if you let me know whether you have
received this message or not and also, when you have removed the account.

Yours Sincerely,
