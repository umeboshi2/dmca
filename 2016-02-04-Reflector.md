I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. The file(s) listed in the GitHub repository https://github.com/wiplug/aircube, titled "For AirCube Project”, are a violation of the copyrighted work of Squirrels LLC. The previously mentioned repository contains decompiled versions of proprietary, unlicensed and exclusive components of the Reflector 2 (previously titled Reflection) software (www.airsquirrels.com/reflector/).

Squirrels LLC is the sole and only owner of Reflector and has not authorized this illegal usage of it’s software. Decompiling our code is not allowed per our EULA and posting the code from our software is forbidden by the DMCA.

To resolve this issue, the user needs to immediately remove and discontinue use of all code hosted in the “Reverse” directory as well as any commit logs or other documents that reference Reflector or Reflection.

I hereby state that I have a good faith belief that the disputed use of the copyrighted material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law (e.g., as a fair use).

I hereby state that the information in this Notice is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that I am the owner, or authorized to act on behalf of, the owner, of the copyright or of an exclusive right under the copyright that is allegedly infringed.

Best,
