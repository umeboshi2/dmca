Why we believe that they are using our software and copyrighted information? We have a key sequence that exposes information about the ROM and some internal tests used within the calculators, and this same key sequence probes they are using TI binaries:

Below 3 examples taken from the GitHub page.

We compared the images provided in the page and they seem to be based in the TI-SmartView™ 1.x Software for Windows® and Mac®. They are not the same format since in SV, on the left in each screenshot, uses SVGs and images hosted on the solution are PNGs. But definetly they seem to be based on TI licensed software. ( See attached License for SV). Also all these images use TI Logo that is a trade mark image.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**    
No forks are shown on github  
**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**    
No open source license, but I believe this is TI Commercial Software under the license mentioned above.    

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**  
The best solution is for them to remove all the files listed above.  

**Do you have the alleged infringer's contact information? If so, please provide it:**
No contact is provided on the page.
