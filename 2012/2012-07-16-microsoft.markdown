> Identify in sufficient detail the copyrighted work you believe has been infringed upon. This includes identification of the web page or specific posts, as opposed to entire sites. Posts must be referenced by either the dates in which they appear or by the permalink of the post.

The material being illegally redistributed in violation of my copyright is part of the Fiddler Web Debugger, found at <http://www.fiddler2.com/fiddler2/>, and more specifically at <http://www.getfiddler.com/dl/Fiddler2Setup.exe>.

> Include the URL to the concerned material infringing your copyright (URL of a website or URL to a post, with title, date, name of the emitter), or link to initial post with sufficient data to find it. Identify the material that you allege is infringing upon the copyrighted work listed above. Include the name of the concerned litigious material (all images or posts if relevant) with its complete reference.

The infringing material is found in a project named "iFiddlr" which your company is redistributing here: https://github.com/iFiddlr/iFiddlr. In particular, the folder <https://github.com/iFiddlr/iFiddlr/tree/master/Fiddler_OriginalCS> contains copyrighted and trade-secret information. The criminals in question left my copyright notice in the source code; which you can plainly see here: <https://github.com/iFiddlr/iFiddlr/blob/master/Fiddler_OriginalCS/AssemblyInfo.cs>

> Provide information on which GitHub may contact you, including your email address, name, telephone number and physical address.

> Provide the address, if available, to allow GitHub to notify the owner/administrator of the allegedly infringing webpage or other content, including email address.

I don't understand this request. GitHub is hosting the material in question. I have no idea whether or not you have the criminal's email address or other contact information.

> Also include an affidavit:

I, [private], have a good faith belief that use and distribution of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner (myself) or its agent (I have none), or the law. I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
