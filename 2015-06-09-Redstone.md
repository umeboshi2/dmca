I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. 

The work that I believe has been infringed is RedstoneLamp (https://github.com/RedstoneLamp/RedstoneLamp) by the project StickyPiston (https://github.com/StickyPiston/StickyPiston) 

To avoid having their content disabled they would need to remove all code that is obviously used by the RedstoneLamp project as is is an obvious copy-paste. 

You can tcontact me by email, or telephone. 

My email is [PRIVATE] and my phone number is [PRIVATE]. 

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. 

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
