**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**  
I own a product called Laraspace which is sold for 25$ through Codecanyon which is a marketplace for selling scripts but the buyers are not allowed to redistribute or post the script online publically for others as it completely invalidates my work.

One of the buyers has posted the script online on github and shared the whole product in public for anyone to download for free.

I request you to please review and remove the repository for the public as it violates the license.

URL of the product:

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  
None.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**  
No! I request you to please remove the repository.
