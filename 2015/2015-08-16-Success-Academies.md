Greetings,

I wish to file a DMCA takedown notice against the repository at
https://github.com/1nv4d3r5/SMS.

The entire repository is proprietary code belonging to Success Academies
which was accidentally made public on GirHub for a short time (at
https://github.com/Success-Academy/SMS). The user 1nv4d3r5 appears to have
cloned the entire repository and put it up on GitHub as his/her own
repository.

We expect that this repository will be taken down forthwith.

My contact details:
