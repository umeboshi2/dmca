Dear Github copyright team,

I have read and understand Githubs guide to filing a DMCA notice.

The user Donghui727 was hired by our company as a freelancer to program an
iOS app called "Pooductive". After some disputes over very messy coding
work we terminated our collaboration after paying all previously agreed on
bills. Once we asked for the access codes to the backend so that the new
programmers could start work and fix his messy coding, he black mailed us
into not giving us the access codes if we don't pay him an additional $500.
Fortunately we were able to circumvent the issue after closely
collaborating with amazon (AWS). However, as a revenge move for not paying
the $500 blackmail money, Donghui727 has now openely published our app
source code against our consent. It is our code, for which we paid him. We
have proof, receipts and a written confession from Donghui which proves
that he blackmailed us. The readme file is further proof of this as well.

We kindly request you remove the "Pooductive" source files as they have
been published against our wishes and can result in great financial damages
for our company.
I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described
above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner,
or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under the penalty of perjury, that the information in this
notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am
authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is
allegedly infringed.

Thank you very much
