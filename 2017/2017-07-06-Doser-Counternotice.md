YES  
**What files were taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository's URL:**  

They listed these in the takedown notice:

It is the entire repository that is infringing located at url that have
now been provided 4 times.

To be clear, it contains all .drg files that are copyright iDoser.com at
location. These are audio files created, owned and sold by iDoser.com
for play in our copyright software:

https://github.com/brainbang/sbagen_idoser/tree/master/drg

There are hundreds of our .drg files in this folder, so we will not be
compiling links to each individual because it is all of them.

An additional directory contains our content (the same), just converted
to another format and also infringing:
https://github.com/brainbang/sbagen_idoser/tree/master/sbg

Again, hundreds of files.

and those two folders are the full content of the repository here:

**Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?** 

I removed the drg files, but dispute the removal the sba source files.  

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake? (optional)**

The sba files are source script files for an open-source program called [sbagen](1) that iDoser illegally included in their program (without source, which the GPLv2 license that sbagen is covered under forbids.) You can read more about the current agreement they have with sbagen [here](2). The SBA files were generated using my own open-source software [drg2sba](3).
