These are how you have to do them in minecraft code. This is the only way you can actually program something like this and cannot follow the original license for that reason. Programming an entity is done a certain way and you simply cannot put a copyright on the basic code that is meant to do this. If you are to bring down my repo for violating this then that would mean that every minecraft mod past, present and future will have to be put under this license. I will remove
