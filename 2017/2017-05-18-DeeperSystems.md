***Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright
owner's behalf?*** Yes.

***Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work
that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it
is posted online.***

The following private repositories have been infringed. The code is
proprietary and not published. The infringing repositories are direct,
literal copies of this code. The infringing deepersystems account (which we
aren't affiliated with) has simply copied from our private repositories
from the LogicalInnovation organization. The only differences are in the
README's, where the user has modified them to remove traces of his actions.
Lately he has also added LICENSEs to the repositories to make it appear as
if it's free software, which it is *not*.

You can verify that I (csaftoiu) am an owner of the LogicalInnovation
repository. Our website is available here - http://www.deepersystems.com/ -
and you can see me listed under "Our Team" -
[private].

Source repositories:

[private]

Finally, we forked an existing repository and made our own contributions to
it, which are private and copyrighted and not released to the public. This
repository is a clone of our repository with our contributions added -
those contributions are the ones infringing our rights in this case:

***What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or
if the entire repository, the repository's URL:***

The following repositories should be taken down as they are just copies of
the ones above, with changes to README or LICENSEs only:

- https://github.com/deepersystems/cvutil  
- https://github.com/deepersystems/bg  
- https://github.com/deepersystems/bg-opencv  
- https://github.com/deepersystems/datasci-hq-backend  
- https://github.com/deepersystems/chess-opencv  
- https://github.com/deepersystems/opencv-gui  
- https://github.com/deepersystems/cvlib  
- https://github.com/deepersystems/consolenet  
- https://github.com/deepersystems/keras_ds

***Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or
repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified
separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken
down.***

It doesn't appear that anyone has forked these repositories yet. The longer
they stay up, the greater the chance of this, of course.

***Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open
source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the
open source license, or are they in violation of the license?***

No, the work has no open source license. It is strictly proprietary company
property. As mentioned, the `deepersystems` user added a LICENSE file to
all of his repositories - this license is *not* present in our original
versions.

***What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there
specific changes the other person can make other than removal?***

We've identified the infringer as an ex-employee. He is clearly doing this
for malicious purposes. The only solution is to remove all of the
repositories, ban the account from GitHub (as it mistakenly appears that it
is affiliated with our company and website, which it isn't), and hope he
doesn't do it again.

***Do you have the alleged infringer's contact information? If so, please
provide it:***

Yes. The username is, of course, deepersystems. The infringer lives in
[private].
