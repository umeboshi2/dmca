Hello,

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

Code available here https://github.com/detectivekim/crumbs_test is actually
one of my items on CodeCanyon marketplace (http://codecanyon.net/item/vanguard-advanced-php-login-and-user-management/14521866)
and it is not released under open source licence.
Code is exactly the same, written in Laravel PHP framework, and he even has
the default Vanguard's logo as another proof that it is actually my item
from CodeCanyon:
https://github.com/detectivekim/crumbs_test/blob/master/public/assets/img/vanguard-logo.png

Please remove the repository or make it private.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described
above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner,
or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this
notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am
authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is
allegedly infringed.
