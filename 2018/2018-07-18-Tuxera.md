**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf?**  

Yes. The copyright owner is Tuxera Inc. ("Tuxera"), a Finland-based software company providing storage and networking software solutions. I am acting as Tuxera's legal counsel.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original copyrighted work is Tuxera NTFS for Mac, which is an add-on NTFS driver for MacOS. More information can be found on our website: .https://www.tuxera.com/products/tuxera-ntfs-for-mac/.

To protect our copyrighted work against unauthorized use, we implement a product key system where an end user needs to activate the software with an individual product key purchased from us.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL:**  

This notice concerns the following repository:  
https://github.com/DoubleLabyrinth/TuxeraNTFS-keygen  

The repository contains content that we believe is designed to generate unauthorized product keys for Tuxera NTFS for Mac, allowing users to circumvent the activation procedure described above and, consequently, access and use our copyrighted software without authorization.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  

We believe the following forks of the original repository also provide similarly infringing means to circumvent the technical protection measures we employ:
