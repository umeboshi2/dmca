Hello GitHub,

My forked repository Spiderlover/ToontownStride,
https://github.com/Spiderlover/ToontownStride ,
just got taken down for copyright infringement by the Toontown Stride staff
member, DenialMC.  

I want to counter this notice, because Disney owns the source code for
Disney's Toontown Online and all Toontown games,
so DenialMC has no excuse to copyright his GitHub commits on the repo,
because it's not his code, it's Disney's code that he's using for the game.
Yes, Disney's Toontown Online got shut down by Disney in September 2013,
but that doesn't give a right for the other Toontown games to copyright
their source code,
because Disney owns the code, not them.  

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Counter Notice.  

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the
material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or
misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.  

I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial
district in which my address is located, and I will accept
service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an
agent of such person.   

Thanks for your time,
