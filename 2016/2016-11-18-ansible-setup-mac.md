*Reason For Request:*

The original repository for ansible-setup-mac was inadvertently delivered
to GitHub. This mistake released proprietary code to the public. The
original repository was taken down, but not before a fork was made at
https://github.com/boxup/ansible-setup-mac. I am requesting this fork be
removed, as it contains proprietary code owned by Booz Allen Hamilton and
the United States Department of Veteran's Affairs. No further action will
be requested.

*The three agreements:*

- I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

* I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described
above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner,
or its agent, or the law. *
- I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this
notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am
authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is
allegedly infringed.

*Work Under Question:*

The proprietary work is the entire fork, located here:
https://github.com/boxup/ansible-setup-mac. I was the original creator of
ansible-setup-mac which was located here:
[already removed by user], but is no longer in
existence.

*What Would Remedy the Infringement:*

Deletion of the fork.
