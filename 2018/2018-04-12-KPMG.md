To whom it may concern,

I am writing to request that the content at the link https://github.com/srinivasscm87/testing be removed as it is infringing upon KPMG LLP's copyright and trademark rights. The content clearly identifies it as being KPMG code and our technical team has validated that the code belongs to KPMG. I have further confirmed that this was posted without the consent of KPMG. It is also using the KPMG mark without KPMG's consent. Lastly, we were unable to identify an actual person to the user account so we were unable to request that the individual who posted the code remove it voluntarily.

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
