**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

I am the copyright owner.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original copyrighted work is a CSV processing module for Python.

The original copyrighted work is the repository hosted on Github here: https://github.com/di/vladiate

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository's URL:**

The infringing work consists of classes and functions copied from the original work, sometimes with slight modifications such as class or variable names being changed, but without any functional differences.

Infringing files are as follows:  
* https://github.com/sietekk/csv.toolkit/blob/master/src/csv/toolkit/validation/validators.py infringes on   https://github.com/sietekk/csv.toolkit/blob/master/src/csv/toolkit/validation/validators.py  
* the `UniqueVal` class infringes on the original `UniqueValidator` class  
* the `BaseTypeValidator` class infringes on the original `CastValidator` class  
* the `IntVal` class infringes on the original `IntValidator`class  
* the `FloatVal` class infringes on the original `FloatValidator` class   
* the `EnumVal` class infringes on the original `SetValidator` class  
* the `UniqueVal` class infringes on the original `UniqueValidator` class  
* the `RegexVal` class infringes on the original `RegexValidator` class  
* the `EmptyVal` class infringes on the original `EmptyValidator` class  
* the `AnyVal` class infringes on the original `Ignore` class  
* https://github.com/sietekk/csv.toolkit/blob/master/src/csv/toolkit/validation/validation.py infringes on   https://github.com/di/vladiate/blob/master/vladiate/vlad.py  
* the `SimpleCSVFileValidator` class infringes on the original `Vlad` class  
* https://github.com/sietekk/csv.toolkit/blob/master/src/csv/toolkit/loaders/loaders.py infringes on   https://github.com/di/vladiate/blob/master/vladiate/inputs.py  
* the `StringLoader` class infringes on the original `String` class  
* the `LocalFileLoader` class infringes on the original `LocalFile` class  

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I have searched for forks of the infringing repository, and I have found none.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

The original work is licensed under the MIT open source license. The infringing files are in violation of that license, specifically the condition that they must retain the original license and copyright notice.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**

The best solution would be for the infringer to simply add the original license (available here: https://github.com/di/vladiate/blob/master/LICENSE) to the top of the infringing files, specifically:  
* https://github.com/sietekk/csv.toolkit/blob/master/src/csv/toolkit/validation/validators.p  
* https://github.com/sietekk/csv.toolkit/blob/master/src/csv/toolkit/validation/validation.py  
* https://github.com/sietekk/csv.toolkit/blob/master/src/csv/toolkit/loaders/loaders.py

The infringer may also remove the infringing files, or remove the repository in it's entirety.

I have already reached out to the infringer (https://github.com/sietekk/csv.toolkit/issues/1) requesting these changes, with no response.
