Re: Electronic Arts - Copyright Infringement and Confidential Information

Dear DMCA Agent:

I write on behalf of Electronic Arts Inc. (“EA”). It has come to our attention that a website hosted by you, www.github.com (the “Site”), contains material that infringes copyrights owned or controlled by EA. Specifically, unauthorized copies of code that contain confidential information about EA’s infrastructure is displayed on the Site. We have previously sent DMCA notices via email to [private] to address this (on September 12 and 14, 2017), but have not received a response.

Pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”), 17 U.S.C. Section 512(c), we demand that you immediately and permanently disable and/or block access to the infringing material, specifically located at:

To be clear, we request all of the content in the link be deleted.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. Upon information and belief, the alleged infringers’ GitHub usernames are shiguosun, ashutoshbapat and rahuldey91.

This letter is not intended to be a full statement of the facts, and it does not prejudice or waive any claim, whether in law or in equity, that EA may have with respect to this matter or any other matter.
If you have any questions concerning this matter, please contact me at [private].
