We represent Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  

We believe we have identified all files or repositories. I am uncertain as to whether all forks have been identified.  

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**  

The infringed artwork is not licensed. It is a protected, copyrighted work.  

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**  

The infringing logo must be removed in all locations. We do not seek removal of other content.
