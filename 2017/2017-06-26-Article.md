We are counsel for TradeMango Solutions Inc. (doing business as Article).

* All product photographs and advertising and promotional images depicting Article products   
* All written product descriptions  
* The Article Website terms of use, privacy policy, shipping terms, return policy and FAQs  
It has recently come to our client's attention that a website hosted on GitHub servers at the URL <www.frameandfabric.com> (the "Frame and Fabric Website") is nearly an exact and unauthorized copy of the Article Website and content.  
As such and in accordance with the GitHub DMCA Takedown Policy, we request that the entire Frame and Fabric Website located at the URL <www.frameandfabric.com> be immediately removed or disabled.  
By way of example of the nature and extent of the infringing content on the Frame and Fabric Website, we wish to bring your attention to the following:  
1. The Frame and Fabric Website Homepage  

* See http://frameandfabric.com  
The homepage of the Frame and Fabric Website is almost an exact copy of the homepage of the Article Website as it appeared on or around March-April 2017.  
Since the Article Website was recently updated to refresh the appearance of the homepage, we attach screenshots captured of the Article Website homepage from March-April 2017 and the Frame and Fabric Website homepage. For your convenience, the Article Website homepage from March-April 2017 can be accessed and viewed at the following URL: https://www.article.com/home/51/mar-6-apr-2.
The layout of the infringing Frame and Fabric Website is nearly identical to that of the Article Website and many of the photographs and images protected by copyright and owned by Article are directly copied without authorization.

The Frame and Fabric Website provides the following product description:

The last sentence above links to the "re:name" page on the Frame and Fabric Website, which purports to describe why Frame and Fabric changed its name from "Bryght". Not only is the content of the "re:name" page identical to that set out on the Article Website, it also:

* uses the same animated GIF file appearing at the top of the page showing the change from "bryght." to "ARTICLE."; and
