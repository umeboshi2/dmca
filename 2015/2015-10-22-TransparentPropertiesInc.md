Hi Github Team,

>I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA

<https://help.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/>

Notice. I've to say that the content on https://github.com/sidaga/mpo2
repository
is a forked copy of an old deleted repository on my profile (
https://github.com/vijeetgv/mpo2). The parent repository was later deleted
as it wasn't open source (against what's written in its Readme.md, which
was written in error) & wasn't supposed to be public. I've been contacted
by its original owner ([PRIVATE])
who doesn't approve of these forks to stay online in public view or in
anyone else's access currently.

The original work in that regard is proprietary so we can't share URLs to
its private repositories without permission from the owner. However, the
infringing fork (https://github.com/sidaga/mpo2) here is a direct literal
copy of the work done by Transparent Properties Inc.

In order to resolve the issue, the user @sidaga, needs to delete the
repository ASAP. If the user doesn't comply, as noted in your takedown
policy (https://help.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy/), as the
user hasn't made any changes to the forked repository and copyright owner
([PRIVATE]) has right over entire repository & that unmodified
repository is a direct literal copy of work done by Transparent
Properties Inc, we request you to disable access to the repository's
content & delete the same.

Myself has been a past team member of Transparent Properties Inc. If you
need more information regarding this, feel free to reach out to myself or
its owner [PRIVATE]. The contact information of both of us is detailed
below:

Infringer's github name: @sidaga

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described
above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner,
or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this
notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am
authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is
allegedly infringed.

Thanks.
