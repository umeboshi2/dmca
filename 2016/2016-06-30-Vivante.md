Dear GitHub,

Please take down the posted software at https://github.com/amxbc/hardware_drivers/tree/master/gpu_vivante.

The software is entirely a posting of Vivante Corporation's proprietary source code rather than any derivative work (Vivante is a wholly owned subsidiary of VeriSilicon Inc). Please also note that I am unable to find the contact information for the poster, so am unable to first request that the GitHub user remove the post.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. Indeed, as mentioned above it is not a "use" of the material in a derivative or collaborative work - it is a wholesale and unauthorized posting of software that does not appear to be in any part the poster's original authored work.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Thanks and Regards,
