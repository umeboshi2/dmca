I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

I am the legal representative authorized to act on behalf of Stripe, Inc.

I have a good faith belief that the following repository consists entirely
of Stripe’s proprietary material and is a direct, literal copy of our
copyrighted work: https://github.com/stripe-interviewr/request-replay

Such use has not been authorized by Stripe, or the law, and therefore
infringes Stripe’s intellectual property rights. We request that the entire
repo be deleted.

I may be contacted by the following methods:

Email: [private]

Name: [private]

Telephone: [private]

Address: 3180 18th Street, Suite 100, San Francisco CA 94110

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described
above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner,
or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this
notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am
authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is
allegedly infringed.

Regards,
