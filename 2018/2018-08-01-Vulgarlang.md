**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

User https://github.com/cawilliams has uploaded every file of my website (www.vulgarlang.com) to this repository https://github.com/cawilliams/vulgarlang-site. Copyright material includes MP3s and JavaScript files. Copyright mark is clearly labelled on the website.

Furthermore, user has deobfuscated code and uploaded to this fork https://github.com/cawilliams/vulgarlang-site/tree/deobfuscating

This is an old version of the website, however the deobfuscated code exposes code and methods used in the current version of my site.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL:**

- https://github.com/cawilliams/vulgarlang-site  
- https://github.com/cawilliams/vulgarlang-site/tree/deobfuscating

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes. Found this fork https://github.com/cawilliams/vulgarlang-site/tree/deobfuscating, as mentioned. Seems to be the only one. Luckily there hasn't been much activity.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No. None of my website is considered open source and is clearly marked as Copyright on vulgarlang.com.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**

The only changes the user has made is deobfuscating the code. Best solution would be removal of both repositories.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it:**

No. No details are provided on their profile. No way to contact them.
