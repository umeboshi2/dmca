**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes. The forks that Dolby has located to date are identified above.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

Dolby does not provide an open source license to the source code at issue here, and the infringing repositories are not permitted by Dolby. Indeed, the header that Dolby uses in its source code, indicating that the code is confidential and belongs to Dolby, appears in eleven of the repositories identified above. Additionally, the name “Dolby” is in the URL of each of the infringing repositories.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**

Removal of the contents of the “Collective-Dolby-Atmos-Parts”, "Dolby-Atmos-ZTE-Axon-7", "Dolby-Atmos-Lenovo-A7000-6.5", "Dolby-Atmos-LeEco-Le-Pro-3", "Dolby-Atmos-LeEco-Le-Max-2", and "Dolby-Atmos-BQ-Aquaris-X5" repositories. There are no changes that the person can make other than removal of the “Collective-Dolby-Atmos-Parts”, "Dolby-Atmos-ZTE-Axon-7", "Dolby-Atmos-Lenovo-A7000-6.5", "Dolby-Atmos-LeEco-Le-Pro-3", "Dolby-Atmos-LeEco-Le-Max-2", and "Dolby-Atmos-BQ-Aquaris-X5" repositories and its content.
