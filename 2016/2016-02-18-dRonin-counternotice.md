Dear Sir or Madam:

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Counter Notice.

The https://github.com/cyphyworks/TauLabs/ repo was taken down. The DMCA filer claimed the following files were illegally distributed:

https://github.com/cyphyworks/TauLabs/blob/dronin_backport_498/flight/targets/sparky/board-info/pios_board.h   
https://github.com/cyphyworks/TauLabs/blob/dronin_backport_498/flight/targets/sparky/fw/pios_board.c   
https://github.com/cyphyworks/TauLabs/blob/dronin_backport_498/flight/Modules/Attitude/attitude.c   

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.

All claimed files were subject to GPLv3 license and were distributed in compliance with such license.

I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.

Sincerely,
