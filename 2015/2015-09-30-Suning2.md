Dear GitHub Copyright Agent:

I am employee of Suning legal department. I write this e-mail to inform you that your users have infringed our intellectual property right; the copyrights of all raw programs belong to Suning. We have tried to contact related personnel in FORK, but did not receive any response. We also tried to file a complaint to the DMCA of GITHUB, DMCA has responded that they were not going to handle this issue and they suggested sending an e-mail to this address.

We request you to delete the related projects of the infringers and inform them that they have infringed our intellectual property right.
