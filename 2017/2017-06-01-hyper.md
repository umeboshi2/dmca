**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

I am the copyright owner.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

My original copyrighted work is located under https://github.com/dkfiresky/hyper-macos.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository's URL:**

https://github.com/equinusocio/hyper-material-theme/blob/master/index.js

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

No, I don't.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

The work is licensed under MIT license. The person (https://github.com/equinusocio) copied parts of the software source code without providing original copyright statement.

Following commit (https://github.com/equinusocio/hyper-material-theme/commit/987f5864785505cf185ce553f389b6a2930c9019) contains copied code from the original repository (https://github.com/dkfiresky/hyper-macos).

I've also tried contacting with the person via creating an issue in his project: https://github.com/equinusocio/hyper-material-theme/issues/18. The person responded with another commits that slightly modify the source code. But it still contains some of my original project source code, for example: https://github.com/equinusocio/hyper-material-theme/blob/master/index.js#L1, https://github.com/equinusocio/hyper-material-theme/blob/master/index.js#L3-L9

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**

There are two solutions:
- provide a copyright notice from the original license (https://github.com/dkfiresky/hyper-macos/blob/master/LICENSE).
- or remove the copied parts of the licensed software.

**Do you have the alleged infringer's contact information? If so, please provide it:**

No, I don't.
