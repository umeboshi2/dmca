Hello,

1. I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

2. The infringing material is inclusive of the entire repository found
at: https://github.com/akaushan/web-service

3. The original work may be found at
https://github.com/cheuschober/fibonacci-service where it is clearly
licensed under the Mozilla Public License (v2.0) and Copyrighted by me,
[Private].

4. The alleged infringement is mostly concerned with the removal of
copyright and attribution. The included diff should succinctly
demonstrate the minimal differences between these two works and an
alleged willful attempt to remove proper attribution and licensing.
Restoration of the license and proper attribution would remedy the
immediate alleged infringement.

5. [Private]

6. The user's account name is `akaushan`

7. I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials
described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the
copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

8. I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this
notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am
authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is
allegedly infringed.

9. Singature is attached.

Warm regards,  
[Private]
