Re: Infringement of the Adobe Systems Incorporated Trademarks and Copyrights

To Whom It May Concern:

1.	I am the legal representative authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of certain intellectual property rights ("IP Owner");

2.	I have a good faith belief that the website https://gist.github.com/vmysla/33ba2c706ec87308b50a offer items and contains materials that are not authorized by the IP Owner, or the law, and therefore infringes the IP Owner's rights; and

3.	The information in this notice is accurate.

4.	I May Be Contacted At:

   Name of IP Owner:	Adobe Systems Incorporated
   Name and Title:	[private]
   Company:	Adobe Systems Incorporated
   Address:	345 Park Avenue, San Jose, CA 95110-2704
   Email:	[private]
   Telephone:	[private]
   Fax:	[private]

5.	The reasons that the URL website must be suspended are as follows:
   a. Offers pirated software or otherwise unauthorized item that violates the IP Owner's trademarks and copyright.
   b. Misuses the IP Owner's brand name, trademarks and copyright.

Please {suspend this website/remove this content} immediately so that our rights are no longer violated and that the proprietor of this site discontinues its criminal activities.

The information in the notification is accurate and under penalty of perjury that the Complaining Party is the owner or is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

By submitting this form, Adobe Systems Incorporated agrees to indemnify against all claims or damages related to the suspension of https://gist.github.com/vmysla/33ba2c706ec87308b50a.

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.
