Yes.

The article in the README file, "thesis based on this project" file, files in the "classification_result" folder (some forks called it "classification_data" due to old version"), files in the "markdown_figures", and files in "raw_training_image" folder, should not be published online since they are private and under my copyright. However, I accidentally pushed them on my repository several months ago and now 13 persons have forked this repository (but no one has made any changes on the forked repositories). I tried to contact them to delete this 2 files but only one person responded me and delete the files. So now I would like to request DMCA to take down those files. (None of them has change the repository so there won't be any loss for them, and if they would like to work on this project later, they can fork my modified repository which won't have any copyright issues)

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL:**

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

All I need to take down are the forked ones. See above links.

MIT License. They are just my work. Those people forked the repository but did not change anythong. Now I just want to take those forks down.

Just remove would be fine.

No.
