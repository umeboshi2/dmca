1. Remove the infringing content (identified below) from your servers; and

2. Notify the infringer of this Notice, and of their duty to remove the infringing content and to refrain from posting infringing content to your servers in the future.

Nature of Infringement

This content circumvents technological measures that effectively control access to works protected under Title 17 of the United States Code.

Description of Technological Measures

Match Group maintains a private API for its Tinder service and licenses its copyrighted material to authorized users pursuant to a limited license contained in the Tinder Terms of Use. In order to enforce the limitations in the license, Tinder employs certain technological measures that include auditing the “user-agent” headers in incoming HTTP requests in order to determine the source of those requests.

Description of Circumvention

This content is designed to circumvent Match Group’s technological protection measures by forging user-agent HTTP headers to misrepresent the source of the HTTP requests. This content allows users to bypass the official Tinder client and improperly access the Tinder backend system to extract proprietary information.
