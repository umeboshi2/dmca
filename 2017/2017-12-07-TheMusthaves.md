Hello,

I hereby submit a DMCA Takedown Notice. *I have read and understand
GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. *For a signed copy, please view the
attached jpeg image file.

The copyrighted work that has been infringed is a portion of our databases.
These databases have been linked to our websites for musthavesforreal.com,
themusthaves.nl and fashionhomerun.nl. It holds product information, but
most importantly, customer information. It can be found on this URL, with
links to three of our databases: https://github.com/sanaullahAhmad/eagleeye/tree/master/DB

In the attachment you see I have placed a contact request with the offender
on Skype. Some of the interface might be in Dutch, but I can translate for
you that 'Dinsdag' means Tuesday, which means that Tuesday 28 November I
nicely tried to contact him, which he has refused to accept.
He used to work for us at the end of 2016, and he got fired off the project
after bad performance. It seems somewhere during his involvement he has
downloaded part of the database and has placed it on Github for everyone to
see. This has nothing to do however with honest sharing of open source
code: the only intent here is to make an infringement on our rights and
cause us harm.

The expected course of action from the offender is to take these complete
sql files down and also delete them from his local device.

notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am

allegedly infringed.*
