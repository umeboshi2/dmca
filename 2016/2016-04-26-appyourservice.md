For us, these are the most important cases we want to have offline from
your website.

We have been creating these codes within our company, one of our employees
[private] had entrance to these repositories and this is the result:).
I would kindly like to ask you to close this account, our name is used,
our code is used, our website teksts are used, our logo is used.

Since 29 march someone is opening up our code to the crowd. This is a big
problem because of copyrights of our code.

All projects lead to our company page, and portfolio pages.
