Hello, I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

I am filing this notice as the user "robipresotto", has copied my code

https://github.com/jathu/UIImageColors to his repo

https://github.com/robipresotto/imageColors without ANY credit and wiping

my name from everywhere.

He pretty much just copied all my code without giving me any credit. He can
copy my code but I strictly requested credit and to keep the original
header.

This user can keep the work up as long as he gives credit to me and Panic
and keep the original header from my "UIImageColors.swift" file:

//
// UIImageColors.swift
// https://github.com/jathu/UIImageColors
//
// Created by [Private] (@jathu) on 2015-06-11 - Toronto
// Original Cocoa version by Panic Inc. - Portland
