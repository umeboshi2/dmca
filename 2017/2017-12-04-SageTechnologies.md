**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**  
Yes. I am [private] of Sage Technologies.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**  
A few months ago, an employee stole sensitive files from a project we're planning to release on the Christmas day of 2017. The original files are stored [private].
Amber is a security module that was written by me. However, he obtained 1/3 of the original module. As such, this contains enough code to jepordize the security of our systems(read/write access to
our databases). The stolen code found [here](https://github.com/Jeamz/Novo) which contains no public license and shows the copyright notice on the README.md file. Our company-group can be found [here](https://github.com/Sage-io).  
All members within that company-group are employees that work for us. As you can see, [private] (Jeamz) is not apart of our company-group.

In conjunction, my IP was posted in the Novo directory. The following files with line
numbers contain my public IP:  
- [private]  
- [private]

That IP goes straight to my home router and someone could do some serious damage with it. Both "master" and "dev" branches are hereby requested by Sage Technologies LLC to be
taken down immediately. Failure in this solution will result in harsh legal action against [private]. Preferably, I formerly request that both the [repository](https://github.com/Jeamz/Novo)
and [user] (https://github.com/Jeamz) to be terminated immediately. As such, this user was working on many of our porjects all of which are private on his account. In an effort to prevent him from
leaking any or all stolen work, we request that this user is to be terminated immediately. Much of our work is built up or on to by many of our employees. As such, this user could make these
projects public, leak much more sensitive data and shamefully claim credit for all work. This breaks our [NDA][private]
which all employees are required to acknowledge and sign before officially working with us. This document is active from which the time they sign to the time they die.

In an effort to stop cases like this, we've cracked down on our company repo and placed all projects under my own account for close monitoring. It's unclear how many other
projects this user may have. Said user is a risk our systems and data and thus, must be dealt with immediately.

*We have asked [private] (Jeamz) numerous times either by phone(text) or by email. No response.*

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository's URL:**  
Repository(master & dev branches): https://github.com/Jeamz/Novo

Master Branch - https://github.com/Jeamz/Novo/tree/master  
Security Module: https://github.com/Jeamz/Novo/tree/master/amber  
SignupController.swift: https://github.com/Jeamz/Novo/blob/master/Novo/SignupController.swift  
LoginController.swift: https://github.com/Jeamz/Novo/blob/master/Novo/LoginController.swift  

Dev Branch - https://github.com/Jeamz/Novo/tree/dev  
All of Sapphire: https://github.com/Jeamz/Novo/tree/dev/Sapphire  
All of Novo: https://github.com/Jeamz/Novo/tree/dev/Novo  
All of Azure: https://github.com/Jeamz/Novo/tree/dev/Azure  

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  
No forks were found in our search. However, this user may have stolen project files that he made private to prevent us from knowing.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**  
Sage Technologies LLC uses github as a way to store our files securely. No one has access to these files but our employees including myself. There is no public open-source license. On the stolen repo our
own [license](https://github.com/Jeamz/Novo/blob/master/LICENSE) can be found. It clear states that you can't steal, copy or publish our code/software.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**  
In both Sage Technologies and [private] (Jeamz) intrest, we formly request that both user [Jeamz] and repository[https://github.com/Jeamz/Novo] are
to be terminated immediately. As stated before, if this doesn't work, we will persue legal action against [private] (Jeamz).

**Do you have the alleged infringer's contact information? If so, please provide it:**  
Username: Jeamz  
Profile: https://github.com/Jeamz  
Full Name: [private]

Email: [private]
