Dear GitHub Copyright Agent:

I, the undersigned, state UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY that:  

[1] I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.  

[2] Copyrighted work I believe has been infringed: Among other things, Qualcomm's confidential and proprietary source code for mobile phone software which Qualcomm shares with third parties only under NDA or similar contract. The names of the folders used by the posting parties makes it patently clear that the materials are Qualcomm-specifically by the use of "qcom/proprietary" or "qcom_proprietary" in the path name of the repository. The folders contain numerous files which appear to be direct, literal copies of Qualcomm's work.

[3] Material I allege is infringing the copyrighted work listed in item #2: Please act expeditiously to remove the following repositories and branches, each of which infringes Qualcomm's rights by reproducing substantial portions of Qualcomm's confidential and proprietary source code:
