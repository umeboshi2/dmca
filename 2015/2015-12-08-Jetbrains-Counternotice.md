For my repository https://github.com/biggbuddy/biggbuddy.github.io , I
believe it is mistakenly disabled by you guys. All those articales are
created by me or declared the references. So it would be great that you
guys enable the repository again. Thanks.

According to your guide line, below is my sentence:

1. I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Counter
Notice.

2. The repository I need to enable is
https://github.com/biggbuddy/biggbuddy.github.io

3. Here are my contact:  
Email: [private]  
Name: [private]  
Phone: [private]  
Address: [private]  
province [private]  

4. I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that
the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or
misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.

5. I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial
district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise
the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will
accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA
notification or an agent of such person.

Thanks for your help!
