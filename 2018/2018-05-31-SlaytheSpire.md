Yes. I am the [private] of Mega Crit Games. We make a game called Slay the Spire.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Slay the Spire is a game purchasable on Steam. https://store.steampowered.com/app/646570/Slay_the_Spire/

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL:**

https://github.com/JoffreyLeblay/slay_the_spire_mod

This repo contains the entirety of my game decompiled. We allow mods to place their code online, but not to put our entire codebase and assets.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

No.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**

They can have the contents of their own mod, but nothing else. Plenty of other Slay the Spire modders have their code up on github in a non-violating fashion.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it:**

No.
