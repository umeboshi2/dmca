__What work was allegedly infringed? If possible, please provide a URL:__  

An ex-employee of ours has recently published all of the work he performed while working for our company, Realeflow, to his github account in public repos. He was a full-time employee at the time he developed these projects for our company and signed an employment agreement stating that all work produced during his employment at Realeflow is the property of Realeflow. The code he published even contains copyright comments within it. Also, there are passwords, security keys, etc, contained in his files that exposed our company to risk. His employment was terminated a couple of years ago and he only just now added those repos in April.

While you're at it, you may want to also consider removal of the project that belongs to American Greetings [private]. I'm sure they would appreciate that too.
